See Exhibit 201.1.1.1.\\n\\n# 1.2 Nonmachinable Criteria\\n\\nA letter-size piece is nonmachinable if it has one or more of the following characteristics (see 601.1.1.2 to determine the length, height, top, and bottom of a mailpiece):\\n\\n- a. Has an aspect ratio (length divided by height) of less than 1.3 or more than 2.5.\\n- b. Is polybagged, polywrapped, enclosed in any plastic material, or has an exterior surface made of a material that is not paper. Windows in envelopes made of paper do not make mailpieces nonmachinable. Attachments allowable under applicable eligibility standards do not make mailpieces nonmachinable.\\n- c.

Is too rigid (does not bend easily when subjected to a transport belt tension of 40 pounds around an 11-inch diameter turn).\\n\\nf. Is less than 0.009 inches thick if the mailpiece is more than 6 inches long or 4-1/4 inches high.\\n\\ng. Has a delivery address parallel to the shorter dimension of the mailpiece.\\n\\nh. Is a self-mailer that is not prepared according to 201.3.14.\\n\\ni. Is a booklet that is not prepared according to 201.3.16.\\n\\n# Physical Standards for Flats\\n\\n# General Definition of Flat-Size Mail\\n\\nFlat-size mail is the following:\\n\\na. More than 11-1/2 inches long, or more than 6-1/8 inches high, or more than 1/4 inch thick, except as allowed for EDDM-Retail flats under 140. For general retail mailability, all pieces 1/4 inch thick or less must be a minimum of 5 inches long and 3-1/2 inches high and 0.007 inch thick.\\n\\nb. Not more than 15 inches long, or more than 12 inches high, or more than 3/4 inch thick.\\n\\nc. Flexible (see 2.3).\\n\\nd. Rectangular with four square corners or with finished corners that do not exceed a radius of 0.125 inch (1/8 inch). See Exhibit 201.1.1.1.\\n\\ne. Uniformly thick (see 2.4).\\n\\nf. Unwrapped, sleeved, wrapped, or enveloped.\\n\\n# Length and Height of Flats\\n\\nThe length of a flat-size mailpiece is the longest dimension. The height is the dimension perpendicular to the length.\\n\\n# Minimum Flexibility Criteria for Flat-Size Pieces\\n\\nFlat-size pieces must be flexible. Boxes—with or without hinges, gaps, or breaks that allow the piece to bend—are not flats. Tight envelopes or wrappers that are filled with one or more boxes are not flats. At the customer’s option, a customer may perform the following test on his or her mailpieces. When a postal employee observes a customer demonstrating that a flat-size piece is flexible according to these standards, the employee does not need to perform the test. Test flats as defined in 201.4.3.\\n\\nDomestic Mail Manual • Updated 7-9-23\\n---\\n# Retail Mail: Physical Standards for Letters, Cards, Flats, and Parcels\\n\\n101 101.3.3\\n\\n|2.4|Uniform Thickness|\\n|---|---|\\n|Flat-size mailpieces must be uniformly thick so that any bumps, protrusions, or other irregularities do not cause more than 1/4-inch variance in thickness. When determining variance in thickness, exclude the outside edges of a mailpiece (1 inch from each edge) when the contents do not extend into those edges. Also, exclude the selvage of any polywrap covering (see 201.5.3) from this determination. Mailers must secure nonpaper contents to prevent shifting of more than 2 inches within the mailpiece if shifting would cause the piece to be nonuniform in thickness or would result in the contents bursting out of the mailpiece (see 601.3.3).|Flat-size mailpieces must be uniformly thick so that any bumps, protrusions, or other irregularities do not cause more than 1/4-inch variance in thickness.

The condensed consolidated financial statements also include McGee Air Services (McGee), a ground services subsidiary of Alaska, and other immaterial business units. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) for interim financial information. Consistent\\n---\\nwith these requirements, this Form 10-Q does not include all the information required by GAAP for complete financial statements. It should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. In the opinion of management, all adjustments have been made that are necessary to fairly present the Company’s financial position as of March 31, 2024 and the results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. Such adjustments were of a normal recurring nature. Certain rows, columns, figures, or percentages may not recalculate due to rounding.\\n\\nIn preparing these statements, the Company is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses, including impairment charges. Due to seasonal variations in the demand for air travel, the volatility of aircraft fuel prices, changes in global economic conditions, changes in the competitive environment, and other factors, operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of operating results for the entire year.\\n\\nFlight 1282 and Boeing 737-9 MAX Grounding\\n\\nAs a result of the Flight 1282 accident and the subsequent grounding of Boeing 737-9 MAX (B737-9) aircraft, Air Group's operation and results were significantly impacted. The Company received compensation from Boeing to address the financial damages incurred as a result of the grounding. As part of this compensation, Boeing paid Air Group $162 million in cash during the first quarter. Subsequent to quarter end, Boeing issued Air Group $61 million in supplier credit memos to be used on future Boeing purchases.\\n\\nCompensation received under the agreement is accounted for as a reduction in cost basis of certain B737-9 aircraft. Proceeds received as of March 31, 2024 are reflected within Aircraft and other flight equipment or Deposits for future flight equipment within the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\\n\\nNOTE 2. PROPOSED ACQUISITION OF HAWAIIAN HOLDINGS, INC.\\n\\nOn December 2, 2023, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. (Hawaiian). The Company has agreed to pay Hawaiian's shareholders $18.00 per share, or approximately $1.0 billion, in cash for the outstanding shares of Hawaiian. In addition, the Company expects to assume Hawaiian's debt and lease obligations on the date of acquisition. The acquisition has been approved by Hawaiian's shareholders and is subject to final approval by various regulatory bodies.\\n\\nOn February 7, 2024, Air Group and Hawaiian each received a request for additional information and documentary material (the “Second Request”) from the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) in connection with the DOJ’s review of the acquisition. On March 27, 2024, Air Group and Hawaiian entered into a timing agreement with the DOJ pursuant to which they agreed, among other things, not to consummate the acquisition before 90 days following the date on which both parties have certified substantial compliance with the Second Request unless they have received written notice from the DOJ prior to the end of such 90-day period that the DOJ has closed its investigation of the acquisition.\\n\\nIn the first quarter of 2024, the Company incurred integration costs of $8 million. These costs are classified as special items within the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company expects to continue to incur integration costs as activities supporting the proposed acquisition continue.\\n\\nNOTE 3. REVENUE\\n\\nTicket revenue is recorded as Passenger revenue, and represents the primary source of the Company's revenue. Also included in Passenger revenue is passenger ancillary revenue such as bag fees, on-board food and beverage, and certain revenue from the\\n---\\n# Passenger Ticket and Ancillary Services Revenue\\n\\n| |Three Months Ended March 31,| | |\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n| |2024|2023| |\\n|Passenger ticket revenue, net of taxes and fees|$1,648|$1,648| |\\n|Passenger ancillary revenue|108|104| |\\n|Mileage Plan passenger revenue|248|232| |\\n|Total Passenger revenue|$2,004|$1,984| |\\n\\n# Mileage Plan Loyalty Program\\n\\n| |Three Months Ended March 31,| | |\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n| |2024|2023| |\\n|Mileage Plan passenger revenue|$248|$232| |\\n|Mileage Plan other revenue|164|154| |\\n|Total Mileage Plan revenue|$412|$386| |\\n\\n# Cargo and Other Revenue\\n\\n| |Three Months Ended March 31,| | |\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n| |2024|2023| |\\n|Cargo revenue|$28|$29| |\\n|Other revenue|36|29| |\\n|Total Cargo and other revenue|$64|$58| |\\n---\\n# Air Traffic Liability and Deferred Revenue\\n\\nPassenger ticket and ancillary services liabilities\\n\\nThe Company recognized Passenger revenue of $584 million and $485 million from the prior year-end air traffic liability balance for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.\\n\\nMileage Plan assets and liabilities\\n\\nThe Company records a receivable for amounts due from the affinity card partner and from other partners as mileage credits are sold until the payments are collected. The Company had $104 million of such receivables as of March 31, 2024 and $102 million as of December 31, 2023.\\n\\n| |Three Months Ended March 31,| | |\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n| |2024|2023| |\\n|Total Deferred Revenue balance at January 1|$2,603|$2,497| |\\n|Travel miles and companion certificate redemption - Passenger revenue|(234)|(218)| |\\n|Miles redeemed on partner airlines - Other revenue|(28)|(21)| |\\n|Increase in liability for mileage credits issued|292|285| |\\n|Total Deferred Revenue balance at March 31|$2,633|$2,543| |\\n\\nNOTE 4. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\\n\\nIn determining fair value, there is a three-level hierarchy based on the reliability of the inputs used. Level 1 refers to fair values based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs and Level 3 refers to fair values estimated using significant unobservable inputs.\\n\\nFair Value of Financial Instruments on a Recurring Basis\\n\\nAs of March 31, 2024, cost basis and fair value for marketable securities were $1.4 billion. Differences in cost basis and fair value of marketable securities are primarily a result of changes in interest rates. Management does not believe any unrealized losses are the result of expected credit losses based on its evaluation of industry and duration exposure, credit ratings of the securities, liquidity profiles, and other observable information as of March 31, 2024.\\n\\n| |March 31, 2024|December 31, 2023|\\n|---|---|---|\\n| |Level 1|Level 2|Total|Level 1|Level 2|Total|\\n|Assets| | | | | | |\\n|Marketable securities| | | | | | |\\n---\\n# U.S. government and agency securities\\n\\n| |Cost Basis|Fair Value|\\n|---|---|---|\\n| |$370|$387|\\n\\n# Equity mutual funds\\n\\n| |Cost Basis|Fair Value|\\n|---|---|---|\\n| |6|5|\\n\\n# Foreign government bonds\\n\\n| |Cost Basis|Fair Value|\\n|---|---|---|\\n| |10|10|\\n\\n# Asset-backed securities\\n\\n| |Cost Basis|Fair Value|\\n|---|---|---|\\n| |170|192|\\n\\n# Mortgage-backed securities\\n\\n| |Cost Basis|Fair Value|\\n|---|---|---|\\n| |103|115|\\n\\n# Corporate notes and bonds\\n\\n| |Cost Basis|Fair Value|\\n|---|---|---|\\n| |695|763|\\n\\n# Municipal securities\\n\\n| |Cost Basis|Fair Value|\\n|---|---|---|\\n| |39|38|\\n\\n# Total Marketable securities\\n\\n| |Cost Basis|Fair Value|\\n|---|---|---|\\n| |376|392|\\n| |1,017|1,118|\\n| |1,393|1,510|\\n\\n# Derivative instruments\\n\\n| |Cost Basis|Fair Value|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Fuel hedge contracts - call options|11|11|\\n|Interest rate swap agreements|9|8|\\n\\n# Total Assets\\n\\n| |Cost Basis|Fair Value|\\n|---|---|---|\\n| |$376|$392|\\n| |$1,037|$1,137|\\n| |$1,413|$1,529|\\n\\nThe Company uses the market and income approach to determine the fair value of marketable securities. U.S. government securities and equity mutual funds are Level 1 as the fair value is based on quoted prices in active markets. Foreign government bonds, asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities are Level 2 as the fair value is based on standard valuation models that are calculated based on observable inputs such as quoted interest rates, yield curves, credit ratings of the security and other observable market information.\\n\\nThe Company uses the market approach and the income approach to determine the fair value of derivative instruments. The fair value for fuel hedge call options is determined utilizing an option pricing model based on inputs that are readily available in active markets or can be derived from information available in active markets. In addition, the fair value considers the exposure to credit losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties. Interest rate swap agreements are Level 2 as the fair value of these contracts are determined based on the difference between the fixed interest rate in the agreements and the observable interest SOFR-based forward rates at period end multiplied by the total notional value.\\n\\n# Activity and Maturities for Marketable Securities\\n\\n|Maturities for marketable securities (in millions):|March 31, 2024|Cost Basis|Fair Value|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Due in one year or less| |$443|$436|\\n|Due after one year through five years| |$939|$907|\\n|Due after five years| |$34|$31|\\n|Due after 10 years| |$14|$13|\\n|No maturity date| |$4|$6|\\n---\\n# Total\\n\\n| |March 31, 2024|December 31, 2023|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Total|$1,434|$1,393|\\n\\n# Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments\\n\\nThe Company uses the following methods and assumptions to determine the fair value of financial instruments that are not recognized at fair value as described below.\\n\\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash: Cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, such as money market funds, commercial paper, and certificates of deposit. They are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.\\n\\nThe Company's restricted cash balances are primarily used to guarantee various letters of credit, self-insurance programs, or other contractual rights. Restricted cash consists of highly liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less. They are carried at cost, which approximates fair value.\\n\\nDebt: To estimate the fair value of all fixed-rate debt as of March 31, 2024, the Company uses the income approach by discounting cash flows or estimation using quoted market prices, utilizing borrowing rates for comparable debt over the remaining life of the outstanding debt. The estimated fair value of the fixed-rate Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificate (EETC) debt is Level 2, as it is estimated using observable inputs, while the estimated fair value of $582 million of other fixed-rate debt, including PSP notes payable, is classified as Level 3, as it is not actively traded and is valued using discounted cash flows which is an unobservable input.\\n\\n| |March 31, 2024|December 31, 2023|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Fixed-rate debt|$1,452|$1,515|\\n|Estimated fair value|$1,346|$1,382|\\n\\n# Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\\n\\nCertain assets and liabilities are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including property, plant and equipment, operating and finance lease assets, goodwill, and intangible assets. These assets are subject to fair valuation when there is evidence of impairment. No material impairments were recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2024.\\n\\n# NOTE 5.

New debt includes proceeds of $150 million which is secured by aircraft. Additionally, $45 million of debt was incurred as part of an agreement to finance certain E175 deliveries. Debt from this agreement is reflected as a non-cash transaction within the supplemental disclosures in the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the Company made debt payments of $102 million.\\n\\n# Debt Maturity\\n\\nAt March 31, 2024, long-term debt principal payments for the next five years and thereafter are as follows (in millions): Total\\n\\n|Remainder of 2024|$201|\\n|---|---|\\n|2025|$365|\\n|2026|$322|\\n|2027|$646|\\n|2028|$131|\\n|Thereafter|$915|\\n|Total Principal Payments|$2,580|\\n\\n# Bank Lines of Credit\\n\\nAlaska has three credit facilities totaling $626 million as of March 31, 2024. One credit facility is for $150 million, expires in March 2025, and is secured by certain accounts receivable, spare engines, spare parts, and ground service equipment. A second credit facility is for $400 million, expires in June 2026, and is secured by aircraft. Both facilities have variable interest rates based on SOFR plus a specified margin. A third credit facility is for $76 million, expires in June 2024, and is secured by aircraft.\\n---\\nAlaska has secured letters of credit against the third facility, but has no plans to borrow using either of the other two facilities. All credit facilities have a requirement to maintain a minimum unrestricted cash and marketable securities balance of $500 million. Alaska was in compliance with this covenant at March 31, 2024.\\n\\nSubsequent to quarter end, the Company executed an amendment to extend the term of the $150 million credit facility from March 2025 to April 2028.\\n\\nNOTE 6.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\\n\\nAlaska continues to experience delivery delays of B737 aircraft. Boeing has communicated that certain B737 aircraft are expected to be delivered later than the contracted delivery dates provided to Alaska. This includes certain B737-10 aircraft contracted for delivery in 2025 that have been moved to 2026, pending certification of the B737-10. We have incorporated these adjustments in the tables below, however, management expects that other Boeing aircraft deliveries may also be delayed later than negotiated delivery timeframes.\\n\\n| |Capacity Purchase Aircraft-Related Commitments(a)|Agreements and Other Obligations (b)|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Remainder of 2024|$1,164|$177|\\n|2025|$830|$230|\\n|2026|$1,634|$223|\\n|2027|$601|$220|\\n|2028|$151|$223|\\n|Thereafter|$717|$515|\\n---\\n# Total\\n\\n$\\n5,097\\n$\\n1,588\\n\\n(a) Includes contractual commitments for aircraft, engines, and aircraft maintenance, and incorporates the impact of expected delays for certain B737 aircraft as communicated by Boeing. Option deliveries are excluded from minimum commitments until exercise.\\n\\n(b) Primarily comprised of non-lease costs associated with capacity purchase agreements, as well as other various sponsorship agreements and investment commitments.\\n\\n# Aircraft Commitments\\n\\nAircraft purchase commitments include contractual commitments for aircraft and engines. Details for contractual aircraft commitments as of March 31, 2024 are outlined below.\\n\\n|Aircraft Type|Firm Orders 2024-2027|Options and Other Rights 2025-2030|Total 2024-2030|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|B737|80|105|185|\\n|E175|7|7|14|\\n|Total|87|112|199|\\n\\nAircraft Maintenance\\n\\nAircraft maintenance commitments include contractual commitments for engine maintenance agreements requiring monthly payments based upon utilization, such as flight hours, cycles, and age of the aircraft. In turn, these maintenance agreements transfer certain risks to the third-party service provider. Alaska has contracts for maintenance on its B737-800 and B737-900ER aircraft engines through 2026 and 2032, respectively. Horizon has contracts for maintenance on its E175 aircraft engines through 2033 and 2039.\\n\\nContingencies\\n\\nThe Company is a party to routine litigation matters incidental to its business and with respect to which no material liability is expected. Liabilities for litigation related contingencies are recorded when a loss is determined to be probable and estimable.\\n\\nAs part of the 2016 acquisition of Virgin America, Alaska assumed responsibility for the Virgin trademark license agreement with the Virgin Group. In 2019, pursuant to that agreement's venue provision, the Virgin Group sued Alaska in England, alleging that the agreement requires Alaska to pay $8 million per year as a minimum annual royalty through 2039, adjusted annually for inflation and irrespective of Alaska's actual use (or non-use) of the mark. The possible range of contractual liability is between $10 million and $160 million. Alaska stopped making royalty payments in 2019 after ending all use of the Virgin brand. On February 16, 2023, the commercial court issued a ruling adopting Virgin Group’s interpretation of the license agreement. The Company has appealed the decision and believes the claims in the case are without factual and legal merit, a position supported by Virgin America’s representations during pre-merger due diligence. Alaska also commenced a separate claim for breach of the agreement against the Virgin Group that may affect the Company’s total liability in the matter.\\n\\nOn April 15, 2024, a private antitrust action captioned Warren Yoshimoto, et al., v. Alaska Airlines, Inc., et al. was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii, against Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Alaska Air Group, Inc. The plaintiffs, whom the complaint describes as airline passengers, allege that the pending acquisition of Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. by Alaska Airlines, Inc. would violate U.S. antitrust laws. They seek to enjoin the merger or\\n---\\n# NOTE 8. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY\\n\\nCommon Stock Repurchase\\n\\nIn August 2015, the Board of Directors authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program. As of March 31, 2024, the Company has repurchased 11.7 million shares for $709 million under this program.\\n\\nShare purchase activity (in millions, except share amounts):\\n\\n| |Three Months Ended March 31,| | |\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n| |2024|2023| |\\n|Shares|Amount|Shares|Amount|\\n|2015 Repurchase Program—$1 billion|561.086|$21|413.554|$18|\\n\\nCARES Act Warrant Issuances\\n\\nAs taxpayer protection required under the Payroll Support Program (PSP) under the CARES Act, the Company granted the U.S. government a total of 1,455,437 warrants to purchase ALK common stock in 2020 and 2021. An additional 427,080 warrants were issued in conjunction with a draw on the CARES Act Loan in 2020. These warrants are non-voting, freely transferable, may be settled as net shares or in cash at the Company's option, and have a five-year term.\\n\\nAs of March 31, 2024, there are 1,882,517 total warrants outstanding, with a weighted average strike price of $39.06. The value of the warrants was estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The total fair value of all outstanding warrants was $30 million, recorded in stockholders' equity at issuance.\\n\\n# NOTE 9.

OPERATING SEGMENT INFORMATION\\n\\nAlaska Air Group has two operating airlines – Alaska and Horizon. Each is regulated by the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Aviation Administration. Alaska has CPAs for regional capacity with Horizon and SkyWest, under which Alaska receives all passenger revenue.\\n\\nUnder GAAP, operating segments are defined as components of a business for which there is discrete financial information that is regularly assessed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) in making resource allocation decisions. Historically, our CODM has reviewed financial performance information for our airline operations and Horizon CPA as part of three reportable operating segments:\\n\\n- Mainline - includes scheduled air transportation on Alaska's Boeing jet aircraft for passengers and cargo throughout the U.S., and in parts of Canada, Mexico, Costa Rica, Belize, Guatemala, and the Bahamas.\\n---\\n# Operating Segments\\n\\nRegional - includes Horizon's and other third-party carriers’ scheduled air transportation for passengers across a shorter distance network within the U.S., Canada, and Mexico under a CPA. This segment includes the actual revenue and expenses associated with regional flying, as well as an allocation of corporate overhead incurred by Air Group on behalf of the regional operations.\\n\\nHorizon - includes the capacity sold to Alaska under CPA. Expenses include those typically borne by regional airlines such as crew costs, ownership costs, and maintenance costs.\\n\\nIn addition to these reported segments, we have a \\\"Consolidating and Other\\\" column which reflects Air Group parent company activity, McGee Air Services, consolidating entries, and other immaterial business units of the company. The “Air Group Adjusted” column represents a non-GAAP measure that is used by the Company's CODM to evaluate performance and allocate resources. Adjustments are further explained below in reconciling to consolidated GAAP results.\\n\\nOver time, our Mainline and Regional airline segments have increasingly been managed as a single component that provides scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo, and includes our loyalty program. Managing this component in an integrated manner enables our team to leverage our comprehensive network, single route scheduling system, and fleet as a single business to deliver optimized consolidated financial results. In the first quarter of 2024, management began evaluating changes to internal reporting that may change the discrete information that is provided to our CODM in the future to better align with the way the business is managed. Such changes may have an impact on the company’s reportable segments once finalized. We will continue to report using the existing segment structure until changes in our internal reporting have been fully implemented, and a segment analysis has been performed to determine if any changes to reportable segments are indicated.\\n\\n| |Mainline|Regional|Horizon|Consolidating & Other(a)|Air Group Adjusted(b)|Special Items(c)|Consolidated|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Operating Revenue|$1,629|$375|$—|$—|$2,004|$—|$2,004|\\n|CPA revenue|$—|$—|$104|($104)|$—|$—|$—|\\n|Mileage Plan other revenue|$149|$15|$—|$—|$164|$—|$164|\\n|Cargo and other revenue|$62|$—|$—|$2|$64|$—|$64|\\n|Total Operating Revenue|$1,840|$390|$104|($102)|$2,232|$—|$2,232|\\n|Operating Expenses| | | | | | | |\\n|Operating expenses, excluding fuel|$1,514|$299|$88|($102)|$1,799|$34|$1,833|\\n|Fuel expense|$485|$93|$—|$—|$578|($13)|$565|\\n|Total Operating Expenses|$1,999|$392|$88|($102)|$2,377|$21|$2,398|\\n|Non-operating Income (Expense)|($3)|$—|($11)|$2|($12)|$—|($12)|\\n---\\n# Income (Loss) Before Income Tax\\n\\n| |Mainline|Regional|Horizon|Consolidating & Other(a)|Adjusted(b)|Special Items(c)|Consolidated|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Operating Revenue|Passenger revenue|$1,673|$311|$—|$—|$1,984|$—|$1,984|\\n| |CPA revenue|$—|$—|$78|($78)|$—|$—|$—|\\n| |Mileage Plan other revenue|$143|$11|$—|$—|$154|$—|$154|\\n| |Cargo and other revenue|$57|$—|$—|$1|$58|$—|$58|\\n|Total Operating Revenue|$1,873|$322|$78|($77)|$2,196|$—|$2,196|\\n|Operating Expenses|Operating expenses, excluding fuel|$1,390|$256|$84|($77)|$1,653|$64|$1,717|\\n| |Fuel expense|$561|$85|$—|($1)|$645|$20|$665|\\n|Total Operating Expenses|$1,951|$341|$84|($78)|$2,298|$84|$2,382|\\n|Non-operating Income (Expense)|($6)|$—|($8)|$1|($13)|$—|($13)|\\n|Income (Loss) Before Income Tax|$84|($19)|($14)|$2|($115)|($84)|($199)|\\n\\nPretax Margin: (5.2)% (9.1)%\\n\\n(a) Includes consolidating entries, Air Group parent company, McGee Air Services, and other immaterial business units.\\n\\n(b) The Air Group Adjusted column represents the financial information that is reviewed by management to assess performance of operations and determine capital allocation and excludes certain charges.\\n\\n(c) Includes special items and mark-to-market fuel hedge accounting adjustments.\\n\\n# Total assets were as follows (in millions):\\n\\n| |March 31, 2024|December 31, 2023|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Mainline|$20,140|$19,937|\\n|Horizon|$1,382|$1,352|\\n|Consolidating & Other|($6,709)|($6,676)|\\n|Consolidated|$14,813|$14,613|\\n---\\n# ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\\n\\nOVERVIEW\\n\\nThe following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand our company and the present business environment. MD&A is provided as a supplement to – and should be read in conjunction with – our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes. All statements in the following discussion that are not statements of historical information or descriptions of current accounting policy are forward-looking statements. Please consider our forward-looking statements in light of the risks referred to in this report’s introductory cautionary note and the risks mentioned in \\\"Item 1A. Risk Factors” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. This overview summarizes the MD&A, which includes the following sections:\\n\\n- GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations and Operating Statistics - reconciliations of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures reported on a GAAP basis, as well as operating statistics we use to measure operating performance.\\n- First Quarter Review - highlights from the first quarter of 2024 outlining some of the major events that occurred during the period.\\n- Results of Operations - an in-depth analysis of our consolidated revenue and expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2024. This section includes forward-looking statements regarding our view of the remainder of 2024.\\n- Liquidity and Capital Resources - an overview of our financial position, analysis of cash flows, and relevant contractual obligations and commitments.\\n\\nGAAP TO NON-GAAP RECONCILIATIONS AND OPERATING STATISTICS\\n\\nWe are providing reconciliations of reported non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measures reported on a GAAP basis. We believe that consideration of these non-GAAP financial measures may be important to investors for the following reasons:\\n\\n- By excluding certain costs from our unit metrics, we believe that we have better visibility into the results of operations. Our industry is highly competitive and is characterized by high fixed costs, so even a small reduction in non-fuel operating costs can result in a significant improvement in operating results. We believe that all domestic carriers are similarly impacted by changes in jet fuel costs over the long run, so it is important for management and investors to understand the impact of company-specific cost drivers which are more controllable by management. We adjust for expenses related directly to our freighter aircraft operations to allow for better comparability to other domestic carriers that do not operate freighter aircraft. We also exclude certain special charges as they are unusual or nonrecurring in nature and adjusting for these expenses allows management and investors to better understand our cost performance.\\n- CASMex is one of the most important measures used by management and by the Air Group Board of Directors in assessing quarterly and annual cost performance. CASMex is also a measure commonly used by industry analysts, and we believe it is the basis by which they have historically compared our airline to others in the industry. The measure is also the subject of frequent questions from investors.\\n- Adjusted pretax income is an important metric for the employee incentive plan, which covers the majority of Air Group employees.\\n- Disclosure of the individual impact of certain noted items provides investors the ability to measure and monitor performance both with and without these special items. We believe that disclosing the impact of these items as noted.\\n---\\n# Above is important because it provides information on significant items that are not necessarily indicative of future performance. Industry analysts and investors consistently measure our performance without these items for better comparability between periods and among other airlines.\\n\\nAlthough we disclose our unit revenue, we do not, nor are we able to, evaluate unit revenue excluding the impact that changes in fuel costs have had on ticket prices. Fuel expense represents a large percentage of our total operating expenses. Fluctuations in fuel prices often drive changes in unit revenue in the mid-to-long\\n---\\n# Mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustment\\n\\n13\\n0.10\\n20\\n0.16\\n\\n# Special items - fleet transition\\n\\n26\\n0.21\\n13\\n0.10\\n\\n# Special items - integration costs\\n\\n8\\n0.06\\n\\n# Special items - labor and other\\n\\n51\\n0.40\\n\\n# Income tax effect of reconciling items above\\n\\n5\\n0.04\\n21\\n0.17\\n\\n# Adjusted net loss per share\\n\\n$116\\n$0.92\\n$79\\n$0.62\\n\\n# Total operating expenses\\n\\n| |2024|2023|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Aircraft fuel, including hedging gains and losses|565|665|\\n|Freighter costs(a)|15|14|\\n|Special items - fleet transition|26|13|\\n|Special items - integration costs|8| |\\n|Special items - labor and other| |51|\\n|Total operating expenses, excluding fuel, freighter costs, and special items|1,784|1,639|\\n\\n# CASMex\\n\\n11.60 ¢\\n10.44 ¢\\n\\n(a) Freighter costs in the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 are not presented separately on the consolidated statements of operations.\\n\\n# OPERATING STATISTICS (unaudited)\\n\\nBelow are consolidated operating statistics we use to measure operating performance.

Despite the impacts of Flight 1282 and the subsequent grounding of the B737-9 fleet, which are outlined more fully below, the Company recorded record first quarter revenue bolstered by strategic capacity deployment and strong leisure and business demand. Revenue improvement, combined with a $100 million decrease in aircraft fuel costs, offset by increased non-fuel operating expenses drove the year-over-year improvement in pretax loss.\\n\\nSee “Results of Operations” below for further discussion of changes in revenue and operating expenses as compared to 2023. A glossary of financial terms can be found at the end of this Item 2.\\n\\n# Flight 1282 and B737-9 Updates\\n\\nAir Group's first quarter operation and results were significantly impacted by Flight 1282 in January and the B737-9 grounding which extended into February. These events negatively impacted results by $162 million in the first quarter, of which approximately $150 million relates to lost revenue and the remainder to incremental costs. The Company received $162 million in cash compensation from Boeing to address these financial damages, which was recorded as an offset to the cost basis of certain B737-9 aircraft. Subsequent to quarter end, Boeing issued Air Group $61 million in supplier credit memos to be used on future Boeing purchases.\\n---\\n# Labor Update\\n\\nIn the first quarter, Alaska technicians, represented by the Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Union (AMFA), ratified a new five-year Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) that includes wage increases and quality of life improvements.\\n\\nAlaska is in negotiations with its flight attendants represented by the Association of Flight Attendants (AFA) for an updated CBA. A mediator from the National Mediation Board is involved in the negotiations. Horizon has initiated negotiations with certain labor groups for updated CBAs, including its pilots, represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters; its flight attendants, represented by AFA; and its technicians, represented by AMFA.\\n\\n# Outlook\\n\\nThe following represents our expectations for the second quarter and full year 2024 results:\\n\\n|Q2 Expectation|\\n|---|\\n|Capacity (ASMs) % change versus 2023|Up 5% to 7%|\\n|Economic fuel cost per gallon|$3.00 to $3.20|\\n|Earnings per share(a)|$2.20 to $2.40|\\n\\n|Full Year Expectation|\\n|---|\\n|Capacity (ASMs) % change versus 2023|&lt; 3%|\\n|Earnings per share(a)|$3.25 to $5.25|\\n|Capital expenditures|$1.2 billion - $1.3 billion|\\n\\n(a) Earnings per share guidance assumes a full year tax rate of approximately 25%\\n\\n# RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\\n\\n# COMPARISON OF THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2024 TO THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2023\\n\\n# OPERATING REVENUE\\n\\nTotal operating revenue increased $36 million, or 2%, in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. The changes are summarized in the following table:\\n\\n| |Three Months Ended March 31,|\\n|---|---|\\n| |2024|2023|% Change|\\n|Passenger revenue|$2,004|$1,984|1%|\\n|Mileage Plan other revenue|164|154|6%|\\n|Cargo and other revenue|64|58|10%|\\n|Total Operating Revenue|$2,232|$2,196|2%|\\n\\nPassenger revenue\\n---\\n# On a consolidated basis\\n\\nPassenger revenue for the first quarter of 2024 increased $20 million, or 1% compared to the same period in 2023. The B737-9 grounding resulted in approximately $150 million in lost revenue, but improvements in corporate travel revenue and general close-in strength helped offset this impact. Increased traffic on ten E175 aircraft added since the first quarter of 2023 also contributed positively to Passenger revenue. Further growth is expected in Passenger revenue throughout 2024 due to diverse revenue offerings, increased capacity, strategic network improvements, and West Coast corporate travel recovery.\\n\\n# Mileage Plan other revenue\\n\\nOn a consolidated basis, Mileage Plan other revenue for the first quarter of 2024 increased by $10 million, or 6%. The increase was driven by higher commissions from the bank card partner, mainly due to increased credit card acquisitions, and higher commission revenue from other third-party partners. Continued strength in Mileage Plan other revenue is expected for the remainder of 2024, supported by higher commissions from increased card spend and incremental partner activity.\\n\\n# Cargo and other revenue\\n\\nOn a consolidated basis, Cargo and other revenue for the first quarter of 2024 increased by $6 million, or 10%. The growth was driven by incremental lounge revenue and other miscellaneous increases. Further growth in Cargo and other revenue is anticipated for the remainder of 2024, fueled by increased freight volumes with the addition of a second B737-800 freighter to the fleet in the second quarter of 2024.\\n\\n# Operating Expenses\\n\\nTotal operating expenses increased $16 million, or 1%, compared to the first quarter of 2023. The breakdown of operating expenses is as follows:\\n\\n| |Three Months Ended March 31, 2024|Three Months Ended March 31, 2023|% Change|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Fuel expense|$565|$665|(15)%|\\n|Non-fuel operating expenses, excluding special items|$1,799|$1,653|9%|\\n|Special items - fleet transition|$26|$13|100%|\\n|Special items - integration costs|$8|$—|NM|\\n|Special items - labor and other|$—|$51|(100)%|\\n|Total Operating Expenses|$2,398|$2,382|1%|\\n---\\nAircraft fuel expense includes raw fuel expense (as defined below) plus the effect of mark-to-market adjustments to our fuel hedge portfolio as the value of that portfolio increases and decreases. Our aircraft fuel expense can be volatile because it includes these gains or losses in the value of the underlying instrument as crude oil prices and refining margins increase or decrease. Raw fuel expense is defined as the price that we generally pay at the airport, or the “into-plane” price, including taxes and fees. Raw fuel prices are impacted by world oil prices and refining costs, which can vary by region in the U.S. Raw fuel expense approximates cash paid to suppliers and does not reflect the effect of our fuel hedges.\\n\\nAircraft fuel expense decreased $100 million, or 15%, compared to the first quarter of 2023. The elements of the change are illustrated in the following table:\\n\\n| |Three Months Ended March 31,| | | |\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| |2024| |2023| |\\n|(in millions, except for per gallon amounts)|Dollars|Cost/Gal|Dollars|Cost/Gal|\\n|Raw or \\\"into-plane\\\" fuel cost|$565|$3.01|$633|$3.35|\\n|Losses on settled hedges|13|0.07|12|0.06|\\n|Economic fuel expense|$578|$3.08|$645|$3.41|\\n|Mark-to-market fuel hedge adjustments|-13|-0.07|20|0.11|\\n|Aircraft fuel, including hedging gains and losses|$565|$3.01|$665|$3.52|\\n|Fuel gallons| |188| |189|\\n\\nRaw fuel expense decreased 11% in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2023, due to lower per gallon costs on decreased refining margins associated with the conversion of crude oil to jet fuel.\\n\\nWe also evaluate economic fuel expense, which we define as raw fuel expense adjusted for the cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period and for the premium expense that we paid for those contracts. A key difference between aircraft fuel expense and economic fuel expense is the timing of gain or loss recognition on our hedge portfolio. Economic fuel expense includes gains and losses only when they are realized for those contracts that were settled during the period based on their original contract terms. We believe this is the best measure of the effect that fuel prices are currently having on our business as it most closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operations. Accordingly, many industry analysts evaluate our results using this measure, and it is the basis for most internal management reporting and incentive pay plans.\\n\\nLosses recognized for hedges that settled during the first quarter were $13 million in 2024, compared to losses of $12 million in the same period in 2023. These amounts represent cash paid for premium expense, offset by any cash received from those hedges at settlement. In 2023, we suspended our crude oil hedge program. Our final option position will settle in the first quarter of 2025.\\n\\nIn the second quarter, we expect our economic fuel cost per gallon to range between $3.00 to $3.20.\\n\\nNon-fuel expenses\\n\\nThe table below provides the reconciliation of the operating expense line items, excluding fuel and other special items. Significant operating expense variances from 2023 are more fully described below.\\n---\\n# Three Months Ended March 31\\n\\n|(in millions)|2024|2023|% Change|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Wages and benefits|$804|$723|11%|\\n|Variable incentive pay|44|47|(6)%|\\n|Aircraft maintenance|122|124|(2)%|\\n|Aircraft rent|47|59|(20)%|\\n|Landing fees and other rentals|165|152|9%|\\n|Contracted services|97|95|2%|\\n|Selling expenses|77|66|17%|\\n|Depreciation and amortization|126|104|21%|\\n|Food and beverage service|58|54|7%|\\n|Third-party regional carrier expense|54|52|4%|\\n|Other|205|177|16%|\\n\\nTotal non-fuel operating expenses, excluding special items: $1,799 in 2024, $1,653 in 2023 (9% change).\\n\\n# Wages and benefits\\n\\nWages and benefits increased by $81 million, or 11%, in the first quarter of 2024. The primary components of Wages and benefits are shown in the following table:\\n\\n|(in millions)|2024|2023|% Change|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Wages|$609|$558|9%|\\n|Payroll taxes|44|41|7%|\\n|Medical and other benefits|83|66|26%|\\n|Defined contribution plans|61|51|20%|\\n|Pension - Defined benefit plans|7|7|—%|\\n\\nTotal Wages and benefits: $804 in 2024, $723 in 2023 (11% change).\\n\\nWages increased $51 million, or 9%, driven by higher wage rates stemming from labor agreements reached with various represented labor groups since the first quarter of 2023, as well as additional impact from irregular operations following the B737-9 grounding. Increased expense for payroll taxes is consistent with the change in wages.\\n\\nIncreased expense for medical and other benefits was primarily driven by an increase in the cost of medical services compared to the prior year. Increased expense for defined contribution plans was driven by the change in wages as well as higher matching contributions for various labor groups.\\n---\\nWe expect to see higher wages and benefits for the remainder of 2024 due to the increase in wage rates and additional agreements we may reach during the year with represented labor groups.\\n\\nAircraft rent\\nAircraft rent expense decreased by $12 million, or 20%, in pe first quarter of 2024. The decrease was primarily driven by pe retirement of ten leased A321neo aircraft fleet from operations, partially offset by pe addition of one leased B737-9 and one leased B737-800 freighter since pe first quarter of 2023.\\n\\nWe expect aircraft rent to remain below 2023 levels for the remainder of 2024, due to the net reduction in leased aircraft described above.\\n\\nLanding fees and oper rentals\\nLanding fees and oper rentals increased by $13 million, or 9%, in pe first quarter of 2024. The increase was driven primarily by higher terminal rent costs resulting from rate increases at many of our facilities, as well as non-recurring favorable settlements pat were realized in 2023.\\n\\nWe expect landing fees and other rentals to increase for the remainder of 2024 as compared to 2023 due to increased capacity and higher rates at airports.\\n\\nSelling expenses\\nSelling expenses increased by $11 million, or 17%, in pe first quarter of 2024. The increase was primarily driven by increased credit card commissions, as well as timing differences.\\n\\nWe expect selling expenses to increase for the remainder of 2024 as compared to 2023, due primarily to higher sales and an increase in marketing costs as we continue to build our brand.\\n\\nDepreciation and amortization\\nDepreciation and amortization increased by $22 million, or 21%, in pe first quarter of 2024. The increase was primarily due to pe addition of 22 owned B737 aircraft and ten owned E175 aircraft to our fleet since pe first quarter of 2023. Incremental depreciation on ground service and oper equipment also contributed to pe increase.\\n\\nOper expense\\nOper expense increased by $28 million, or 16%, in pe first quarter of 2024. The increase was primarily driven by passenger remuneration and crew hotel costs due to pe B737-9 grounding. Additional software expenses also contributed to pe increase.\\n\\nSpecial items - fleet transition\\n\\nWe recorded expenses associated with the Company's fleet transition of $26 million in the first quarter of 2024. These costs consist of certain aircraft maintenance work performed as a result of the fleet retirements, adjustments to estimated costs to return the A320 fleet, and holdover rent for Airbus aircraft which have not yet been returned to the lessor as of the lease expiration date.\\n\\nSpecial items - integration costs\\n---\\nWe recorded $8 million in integration costs associated with our proposed acquisition of Hawaiian Airlines. These costs primarily consist of professional services fees. We expect to incur additional integration costs as activities supporting the proposed acquisition continue.\\n\\n# ADDITIONAL SEGMENT INFORMATION\\n\\nRefer to Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of each segment. Below is a summary of each segment's results.\\n\\nMainline\\nMainline operations reported an adjusted pretax loss of $162 million in pe first quarter of 2024, compared to a loss of $84 million in pe same period in 2023. The $78 million decrease was driven by decreased passenger revenue as a result of pe B737-9 grounding, as well as increased non-fuel operating expenses, which were primarily driven by higher wage rates across various labor groups and incremental ownership costs associated wip 22 owned B737 aircraft added to Alaska's fleet since pe first quarter of 2023. These increases were partially offset by decreased fuel costs due to lower per gallon costs and fewer gallons consumed.\\n\\nRegional\\nRegional operations reported an adjusted pretax loss of $2 million in pe first quarter of 2024, compared to a loss of $19 million in pe same period in 2023. The $17 million improvement was driven by higher passenger revenue consistent wip pe increase in traffic, partially offset by higher operating expenses driven by increased capacity.\\n\\nHorizon\\nHorizon reported an adjusted pretax profit of $5 million in pe first quarter of 2024, compared to a loss of $14 million in pe same period in 2023. The $19 million improvement was driven by incremental revenue consistent wip increased capacity sold to Alaska, as well as cost reductions resulting from Horizon's transition to a single fleet. These improvements were partially offset by increased expenses driven by pe addition of ten owned E175 aircraft added to Horizon's fleet since pe first quarter of 2023.\\n\\n# LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\\n\\nOur primary sources of liquidity are:\\n\\n- Existing cash and marketable securities of $2.3 billion;\\n- Cash flows from operations of $292 million;\\n- Our Mileage Plan program and 63 unencumbered aircraft which could be financed, if necessary;\\n- Combined bank line-of-credit facilities, with no outstanding borrowings, of $550 million.\\n\\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2024, we incurred new debt of $195 million and made debt payments of $102 million. We ended the quarter with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 47%, within our target range of 40% to 50%.

Cash provided by ticket sales and from our co-branded credit card agreement are the primary sources of our operating cash flow. Our primary use of operating cash flow is for operating expenses, including payments for employee wages and benefits, payments to suppliers for goods and services, and payments to lessors and airport authorities for rents and landing fees. Operating cash flow also includes payments to, or refunds from, federal, state, and local taxing authorities.\\n\\nThe $70 million net increase in our operating cash flows was due to a combination of factors. Payments made in 2024 for our 2023 incentive pay program were approximately $60 million lower than payments in 2023 for our 2022 program. Additionally, growth in our air traffic liability increased $35 million in the first quarter compared to the prior year. These amounts were partially offset by other changes in working capital accounts.\\n\\nCash Provided by Investing Activities\\n\\nCash provided by investing activities was $318 million during the first three months of 2024, compared to $60 million in 2023. The change was due to a combination of factors. In the first quarter, the Company received $162 million in compensation from Boeing related to the B737-9 grounding, which is presented as Supplier proceeds. Total property and equipment expenditures decreased $67 million as we took no deliveries of B737-9 aircraft in the first quarter of 2024 compared to three owned B737-9 deliveries in the prior period, and due to changes in\\n---\\ncontractual terms of our aircraft purchase deposit schedule with Boeing. Cash flows from other investing activities increased $96 million due to the sale of certain A321neo aircraft. These changes were partially offset by decreased cash flows from net sales of marketable securities, which were $120 million in 2024, compared to $187 million in 2023.\\n\\nCash Used in Financing Activities\\n\\nCash used in financing activities was $5 million during the first three months of 2024, compared to $114 million in 2023. The change was largely driven by $149 million in new debt proceeds in 2024 compared to zero in 2023, partially offset by increased cash used in other financing activities, of which the settlement of our final A321neo finance lease was the largest component.\\n\\nMATERIAL CASH COMMITMENTS\\n\\nMaterial cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations. In prior filings, we had indicated our expected capital expenditures for 2024 would be approximately $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. Based on management's assumptions regarding aircraft delivery delays in 2024, described in more detail below, we now expect 2024 capital expenditures to be approximately $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion.\\n\\nAircraft Commitments\\n\\nAs of March 31, 2024, Alaska had firm orders to purchase 80 B737 aircraft with deliveries between 2024 and 2027. Alaska also had rights for 105 additional B737 aircraft through 2030.\\n\\nAlaska continues to experience delivery delays of B737 aircraft. Boeing has communicated that certain B737 aircraft are expected to be delivered later than the contracted delivery dates provided to Alaska. This includes certain B737-10 aircraft contracted for delivery in 2025 that have been moved to 2026, pending certification of the B737-10. We have incorporated these adjustments in the tables below, however, management expects that other Boeing aircraft deliveries may also be delayed later than negotiated delivery timeframes.\\n\\nAs of March 31, 2024, Horizon had commitments to purchase seven E175 aircraft with deliveries between 2024 and 2026. Horizon also had options to acquire seven E175 aircraft between 2025 and 2026. The remaining E175 delivery expected in 2024 is covered under a financing agreement executed in 2023. Capital expenditures for this delivery, which are included within aircraft-related commitments in the contractual obligations table below, will be reflected as a non-cash transaction in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Subsequent to quarter end, two of Horizon's seven E175 options expired.\\n\\nOptions will be exercised only if we believe return on invested capital targets can be met over the long term.\\n\\n|Aircraft|March 31, 2024|2024 Changes|Dec 31, 2024|2025 Changes|Dec 31, 2025|Changes Dec 31, 2026|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|B737-700 Freighters|3|—|3|—|3|—|3|\\n|B737-800 Freighters|1|1|2|—|2|—|2|\\n|B737-700|11|—|11|—|11|—|11|\\n---\\n|Aircraft Type|B737-800|B737-900|B737-900ER|B737-8|B737-9|B737-10|Total|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Total Mainline Fleet|59|12|79|1|64|-|230|\\n| |59|12|79|7|16|-|24|\\n| |59|12|79|8|80|-|254|\\n| |59|12|79|12|-|-|12|\\n| |59|12|79|20|80|-|266|\\n| |59|12|79|-|-|30|30|\\n|Total Mainline Fleet|230|24|266|12|80|30|296|\\n\\n|Aircraft Type|E175 operated by Horizon|E175 operated by third party|Total Regional Fleet|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Total|43|42|85|\\n| |1|-|1|\\n| |44|42|86|\\n| |3|1|4|\\n| |47|43|90|\\n| |3|-|3|\\n|Total Regional Fleet|50|43|93|\\n\\n| |Approximate % of Expected Fuel Requirements|Weighted-Average Crude Oil Price per Barrel|Average Premium Cost per Barrel|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Second Quarter of 2024|40%|$90|$5|\\n|Third Quarter of 2024|30%|$88|$5|\\n|Fourth Quarter of 2024|20%|$87|$5|\\n|Full Year 2024|30%|$88|$5|\\n|First Quarter of 2025|10%|$92|$5|\\n|Full Year 2025|2%|$92|$5|\\n---\\n| |Remainder of 2024|2025|2026|2027|2028|Beyond 2028|Total|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Debt obligations|$201|$365|$322|$646|$131|$915|$2,580|\\n|Lease commitments(a)|$173|$204|$204|$196|$187|$705|$1,669|\\n|Aircraft-related commitments(b)|$1,164|$830|$1,634|$601|$151|$717|$5,097|\\n|Interest obligations(c)|$99|$110|$124|$99|$54|$115|$601|\\n|CPA and other obligations|$177|$230|$223|$220|$223|$515|$1,588|\\n\\n(a) Lease commitments include minimum payments for aircraft (operating and non-operating) with associated operating leases, as we have remaining cash obligations under existing terms. It also includes minimum lease payments for facilities.\\n\\n(b) Includes contractual commitments for aircraft, engines, and aircraft maintenance, and incorporates the impact of expected delays for certain B737 aircraft as communicated by Boeing. Option deliveries are excluded from minimum commitments until exercise.\\n\\n(c) For variable-rate debt, future obligations are shown above using interest rates forecast as of March 31, 2024.\\n\\nDebt Obligations and Interest Obligations\\n\\nThe Company primarily issues debt to fund purchases of aircraft or other capital expenditures. At March 31, 2024, our debt portfolio carries a weighted average interest rate of 4.6%. Interest is paid with regular debt service. Debt service obligations remaining in 2024 are expected to be approximately $300 million, inclusive of interest and principal. Refer to Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt and interest balances.\\n\\nCPA and Other Obligations\\n\\nWe have obligations primarily associated with our capacity purchase agreements between Alaska and SkyWest, as well as other various sponsorship agreements and investment commitments.\\n\\nLeased Aircraft Return Costs\\n\\nFor leased aircraft, contractual terms require us to return the aircraft in a specified state. As a result of these contractual terms, we incur significant costs to return these aircraft at the termination of the lease. Costs to return leased aircraft are accrued when the costs are probable and reasonably estimable, usually over the twelve months prior to the lease return or any expected early retirement date, unless a determination is made to remove the leased asset from operation. If the leased aircraft is removed from the operating fleet, the estimated cost to return is accrued at the time of removal. Lease return accrual estimates are based on the time remaining on the lease and the provisions included in the lease agreement, although the actual amount due to any lessor upon return may not be known with certainty until lease termination. At March 31, 2024, $90 million is accrued for lease returns, and classified within Other accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\\n\\nCredit Card Agreements\\n\\nAlaska has agreements with a number of credit card companies to process the sale of tickets and other services. Under these agreements, there are material adverse change clauses that, if triggered, could result in the credit card companies holding back a reserve from our credit card receivables. Under one such agreement, we could be required to maintain a reserve if our credit rating is downgraded to or below a rating specified by the agreement or our cash and marketable securities balance fell below $500 million. Under another such agreement, we could be required to maintain a reserve if our cash and marketable securities balance fell below $500 million. We are not currently\\n---\\nrequired to maintain any reserve under these agreements, but if we were, our financial position and liquidity could be materially harmed.\\n\\n# Sustainability Commitments\\n\\nAs part of our efforts to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040, we have outlined a five-part path that includes operational efficiency, fleet renewal, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), investing in new technologies, and using credible offsetting and removal technologies to close the gaps to our emissions target in future years. We anticipate these efforts will require cash outlays, not all of which are reflected in our contractual commitments. Finding and establishing relationships with suppliers to meet these commitments is in process. Currently, Alaska has certain agreements to purchase SAF to be delivered in the coming years. These agreements are dependent on suppliers' ability to obtain all required governmental and regulatory approvals, achieve commercial operation, and produce sufficient quantities of SAF. Financial commitments that have been contractually established and have defined minimum obligations, including those related to Alaska Star Ventures, are included within the CPA and other obligations row in the above table.\\n\\n# Income Taxes\\n\\nFor federal income tax purposes, the majority of our property and equipment are fully depreciated over a seven-year life using an accelerated depreciation method or bonus depreciation, if available. For financial reporting purposes, the majority of our assets are depreciated over 15 to 25 years to an estimated salvage value using the straight-line basis. This difference has created a significant deferred tax liability. At some point in the future, the property and equipment difference will reverse into taxable income, potentially resulting in an increase in income taxes payable.\\n\\nWhile it is possible that we could have material cash obligations for this deferred liability at some point in the future, we cannot estimate the timing of long-term cash flows with reasonable accuracy. Taxable income and cash taxes payable in the short term are impacted by many items, including the amount of book income generated (which can be volatile depending on revenue and fuel prices, among other factors out of our control), whether bonus depreciation provisions are available, as well as other legislative changes beyond our control. We believe we have the liquidity to make our future tax payments.\\n\\n# Proposed Acquisition of Hawaiian Holdings Inc.\\n\\nOn December 2, 2023, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. (Hawaiian). The Company has agreed to pay Hawaiian's shareholders $18.00 per share, or approximately $1.0 billion, in cash for the outstanding shares of Hawaiian. In addition, the Company expects to assume Hawaiian's debt and lease obligations on the date of acquisition. The acquisition is dependent on approval by various regulatory bodies and other customary closing conditions. The Company expects to fund this acquisition through a combination of existing cash and marketable securities, new debt, as well as other available sources of liquidity.\\n\\n# CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\\n\\nThere have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates during the three months ended March 31, 2024.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\\n\\n# Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\\n\\nAs of March 31, 2024, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer (collectively, our “certifying officers”), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. These disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in our periodic reports filed with or submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms, and includes, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our certifying officers, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our certifying officers concluded, based on their evaluation, that disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2024.\\n\\n# Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\n\\nThere have been no changes in the Company’s internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2024, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.\\n\\nOur internal control over financial reporting is based on the 2013 framework in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO Framework).\\n---\\nThe Company is a party to routine litigation matters incidental to its business and with respect to which no material liability is expected. Liabilities for litigation related contingencies are recorded when a loss is determined to be probable and estimable.\\n\\nAs part of the 2016 acquisition of Virgin America, Alaska assumed responsibility for the Virgin trademark license agreement with the Virgin Group. In 2019, pursuant to that agreement's venue provision, the Virgin Group sued Alaska in England, alleging that the agreement requires Alaska to pay $8 million per year as a minimum annual royalty through 2039, adjusted annually for inflation and irrespective of Alaska's actual use (or non-use) of the mark. The possible range of contractual liability is between $10 million and $160 million. Alaska stopped making royalty payments in 2019 after ending all use of the Virgin brand. On February 16, 2023, the commercial court issued a ruling adopting Virgin Group’s interpretation of the license agreement. The Company has appealed the decision and believes the claims in the case are without factual and legal merit, a position supported by Virgin America’s representations during pre-merger due diligence. Alaska also commenced a separate claim for breach of the agreement against the Virgin Group that may affect the Company’s total liability in the matter.\\n\\nOn April 15, 2024, a private antitrust action captioned Warren Yoshimoto, et al., v. Alaska Airlines, Inc., et al. was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii, against Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Alaska Air Group, Inc. The plaintiffs, whom the complaint describes as airline passengers, allege that the pending acquisition of Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. by Alaska Airlines, Inc. would violate U.S. antitrust laws. They seek to enjoin the merger or obtain divestitures, as well as costs and attorneys’ fees. The Company believes the allegations in the complaint are without merit and will defend against them vigorously, while continuing to work cooperatively with the U.S. Department of Justice to obtain regulatory clearance to close the acquisition.\\n\\n# ITEM 1A.

Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ\\nmaterially from historical experience or our present expectations. Known material risk factors applicable to Delta\\nare described in \\\"Item 1A.

(the Company) as of\\nMarch 31, 2024, the related condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income/(loss),\\ncondensed consolidated statements of cash flows, and consolidated statements of stockholders' equity for the three-\\nmonth periods ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \\\"condensed\\nconsolidated interim financial statements\\\"). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications\\nthat should be made to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with\\nU.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\\n---\\n# We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2023, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, cash flows, and stockholders' equity for the year then ended, and the related notes (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 12, 2024, we expressed an unqualified audit opinion on those Consolidated Financial Statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been derived.\\n\\n# Basis for Review Results\\n\\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim financial statements consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.\\n\\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\\n\\nAtlanta, Georgia April 10, 2024\\n\\n# Financial Statements\\n\\n**DELTA AIR LINES, INC.

6\\n\\n# Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements DELTA AIR LINES, INC.\\n\\nNotes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\\n\\nNOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\\n\\nBasis of Presentation\\n\\nThe accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Delta Air Lines, Inc. and our consolidated subsidiaries, and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\\\"GAAP\\\") for interim financial information. Consistent with these requirements, this Form 10-Q does not include all the information required by GAAP for complete financial statements. As a result, this Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\\n---\\n# Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\\n\\nManagement believes the accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements reflect all adjustments, including normal recurring items, considered necessary for a fair statement of results for the interim periods presented.\\n\\nDue to seasonal variations in the demand for air travel, the volatility of aircraft fuel prices and other factors, operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of operating results for the entire year.\\n\\nWe reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period presentation. Unless otherwise noted, all amounts disclosed are stated before consideration of income taxes.\\n\\n# NOTE 2. REVENUE RECOGNITION\\n\\n|Passenger Revenue|Three Months Ended March 31,| | |\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|(in millions)|2024|2023| |\\n|Ticket|$9,833|$9,239| |\\n|Loyalty travel awards|$844|$743| |\\n|Travel-related services|$454|$429| |\\n|Passenger revenue|$11,131|$10,411| |\\n\\nTicket\\n\\nWe recognized approximately $3.9 billion in passenger revenue during both the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 that had been recorded in our air traffic liability balance at the beginning of those periods.\\n\\nLoyalty Travel Awards\\n\\nLoyalty travel awards revenue is related to the redemption of mileage credits (\\\"miles\\\") for air travel. Our SkyMiles loyalty program allows customers to earn miles by flying on Delta, Delta Connection and other airlines that participate in the loyalty program. Customers can also earn miles through participating companies, such as credit card, retail, ridesharing, car rental and hotel companies, who purchase miles from us. Our most significant contract to sell miles relates to our co-brand credit card relationship with American Express. During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, total cash sales from marketing agreements related to our loyalty program were $1.8 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively, which are allocated to travel and other performance obligations.\\n\\nCurrent Activity of the Loyalty Program. Miles are combined in one homogeneous pool and are not separately identifiable. Therefore, revenue is comprised of miles that were part of the loyalty program deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the period as well as miles that were issued during the period. The timing of mile redemptions can vary widely; however, the majority of miles have historically been redeemed within two years of being earned.\\n\\nThe table below presents the activity of the current and noncurrent loyalty program deferred revenue and includes miles earned through travel and miles sold to participating companies, which are primarily through marketing agreements.\\n---\\n# Loyalty program activity\\n\\n| |2024|2023|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Balance at January 1|$8,420|$7,882|\\n|Miles earned|1,021|999|\\n|Miles redeemed for air travel|(844)|(743)|\\n|Miles redeemed for non-air travel and other|(56)|(40)|\\n|Balance at March 31|$8,541|$8,098|\\n\\n# Travel-Related Services\\n\\nTravel-related services are primarily composed of services performed in conjunction with a passenger’s flight and include baggage fees, administrative fees and on-board sales.\\n\\n# Other Revenue\\n\\n| |Three Months Ended March 31,|\\n|---|---|\\n|Refinery|$1,185|$916|\\n|Loyalty program|$795|$726|\\n|Ancillary businesses|$180|$231|\\n|Miscellaneous|$279|$266|\\n|Other revenue|$2,439|$2,139|\\n\\nRefinery. This represents refinery sales to third parties. See Note 9, \\\"Segments,\\\" for more information on revenue recognition within our refinery segment.\\n\\nLoyalty Program. This relates to revenues from brand usage by third parties and other performance obligations embedded in miles sold, which are included within the total cash sales from marketing agreements, discussed above. This also includes the redemption of miles for non-air travel and other awards.\\n\\nAncillary Businesses. This includes aircraft maintenance services we provide to third parties and our vacation wholesale operations.\\n\\nMiscellaneous. This is primarily composed of lounge access, including access provided to certain American Express cardholders, and codeshare revenues.\\n\\n# Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\\n\\nRevenue by Geographic Region\\n\\nOperating revenue for the airline segment is recognized in a specific geographic region based on the origin, flight path and destination of each flight segment.

Cash equivalents generally consist of money market funds. Restricted cash equivalents generally consist of money market funds, time deposits, commercial paper and negotiable certificates of deposit. Restricted cash equivalents primarily relate to proceeds from debt issued to finance, among other things, a portion of the construction costs for our new terminal facilities at New York's LaGuardia Airport as well as certain self-insurance obligations and airport commitments. Restricted cash equivalents are recorded in prepaid expenses and other on our Consolidated Balance Sheet (\\\"balance sheet\\\"). The fair value of these cash equivalents is based on a market approach using prices generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets.\\n\\nShort-Term Investments. The fair values of our short-term investments are based on a market approach using industry standard valuation techniques that incorporate observable inputs such as quoted market prices, interest rates, benchmark curves, credit ratings of the security and other observable information. These investments are expected to mature in one year or less.\\n\\nLong-Term Investments and Related. Our long-term investments measured at fair value primarily consist of equity investments, which are valued based on market prices or other observable transactions and inputs, and are recorded in equity investments on our balance sheet. Our equity investments in private companies are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as their equity is not traded on a public exchange and our valuations incorporate certain unobservable inputs, including non-public equity issuances. Fair value measurement using unobservable inputs is inherently uncertain, and a change in significant inputs could result in different fair values. See Note 4, \\\"Investments,\\\" for further information on our equity investments.\\n\\nFuel Hedge Contracts. Our derivative contracts to hedge the financial risk from changing fuel prices are related to inventory at our wholly-owned subsidiary, Monroe Energy, LLC (\\\"Monroe\\\"). We recognized losses of $96 million and gains of $31 million on our fuel hedge contracts in aircraft fuel and related taxes on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income/(Loss) (\\\"income statement\\\") for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The losses recognized during the first three months of 2024 were composed of $27 million of mark-to-market losses and $69 million of settlement losses on contracts. Gains and losses on settled contracts are reflected within Monroe's operating results. See Note 9, \\\"Segments,\\\" for further information on our Monroe refinery segment.\\n\\nNOTE 4.

MD&A\\n\\n# ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\\n\\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in our 2023 Form 10-K.\\n\\n# March 2024 Quarter Financial Highlights\\n---\\n# Results of Operations - Three Months Ended March 31, 2024 and 2023\\n\\n|Total Operating Revenue|Three Months Ended March 31, 2024|Three Months Ended March 31, 2023|Increase (Decrease)|% Increase (Decrease)|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Ticket - Main cabin|$5,425|$5,223|$202|4%|\\n\\nOur operating income for the March 2024 quarter improved $891 million compared to the March 2023 quarter to $614 million for the reasons discussed below.\\n\\nRevenue. Compared to the March 2023 quarter, our total revenue increased $989 million, or 8%, due primarily to a 7% increase in capacity and continued strength in travel demand across all geographic regions, particularly for our premium products. Total revenue, adjusted (a non-GAAP financial measure, which excludes revenue related to refinery sales to third parties) increased in the March 2024 quarter by $721 million, or 6%, compared to the March 2023 quarter.\\n\\nOperating Expense. Total operating expense in the March 2024 quarter increased $98 million, or 1%, compared to the March 2023 quarter, primarily due to higher employee costs from increased wages and profit sharing and increased costs associated with higher capacity, partially offset by the one-time pilot agreement-related expenses in 2023. Total operating expense, adjusted (a non-GAAP financial measure) in the March 2024 quarter increased $627 million, or 6%, compared to the March 2023 quarter. Adjustments were primarily to exclude expenses related to refinery sales to third parties and the one-time pilot agreement-related expenses in 2023.\\n\\nOur total operating cost per available seat mile (\\\"CASM\\\") decreased 6% compared to the March 2023 quarter, primarily due to a 7% increase in capacity, as well as the one-time pilot agreement-related expenses in 2023. Non-fuel unit cost (\\\"CASM-Ex\\\", a non-GAAP financial measure) increased 1.5%, primarily due to higher employee costs from increased wages and profit sharing.\\n\\nCash Flow. Our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and aggregate undrawn principal amount available under our revolving credit facilities (\\\"liquidity\\\") as of March 31, 2024, was $7.4 billion.\\n\\nDuring the March 2024 quarter, operating activities generated $2.4 billion. Cash flows from operating activities benefited from the sale of tickets to managed corporate customers, including tickets for travel during and beyond the quarter, which grew 14% during the March 2024 quarter compared to the March 2023 quarter, led by large accounts, particularly in the technology, consumer services, and financial services sectors. In addition, total cash sales to American Express were $1.7 billion in the March 2024 quarter, an increase of approximately 5% compared to the March 2023 quarter.\\n\\nCash flows used in investing activities during the quarter totaled $637 million as capital expenditures were partially offset by redemptions of short-term investments. These operating and investing activities yielded free cash flow (a non-GAAP financial measure) of $1.4 billion in the March 2024 quarter. Additionally, we had cash outflows of $712 million related to repayments of our debt and finance leases.\\n\\nThe non-GAAP financial measures referenced above for total revenue, adjusted, operating expense, adjusted, CASM-Ex, and free cash flow are defined and reconciled in \\\"Supplemental Information\\\" below.\\n---\\n# Ticket - Premium products\\n\\n| |March 2024|March 2023|Change|Percentage|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Revenue|4,408|4,016|392|10%|\\n\\n# Loyalty travel awards\\n\\n| |March 2024|March 2023|Change|Percentage|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| |844|743|101|14%|\\n\\n# Travel-related services\\n\\n| |March 2024|March 2023|Change|Percentage|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| |454|429|25|6%|\\n\\n# Passenger revenue\\n\\n| |March 2024|March 2023|Change|Percentage|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| |$11,131|$10,411|$720|7%|\\n\\n# Cargo\\n\\n| |March 2024|March 2023|Change|Percentage|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| |178|209|(31)|(15)%|\\n\\n# Other\\n\\n| |March 2024|March 2023|Change|Percentage|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| |2,439|2,139|300|14%|\\n\\n# Total operating revenue\\n\\n| |March 2024|March 2023|Change|Percentage|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| |$13,748|$12,759|$989|8%|\\n\\n# TRASM (cents)\\n\\n| |March 2024|March 2023|Change|Percentage|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| |20.98 ¢|20.80 ¢|0.18 ¢|1%|\\n\\n# Third-party refinery sales\\n\\n| |March 2024|March 2023|Change|Percentage|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| |(1.81)|(1.49)|(0.32)|21%|\\n\\n# TRASM, adjusted(2)\\n\\n| |March 2024|March 2023|Change|Percentage|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| |19.17 ¢|19.30 ¢|(0.13)¢|(0.7)%|\\n\\n(1) Total amounts in the table above may not calculate exactly due to rounding.\\n\\n(2) Total Revenue per available seat mile (\\\"TRASM\\\"), adjusted is a non-GAAP financial measure. For additional information on adjustments to TRASM, see \\\"Supplemental Information\\\" below.\\n\\nCompared to the March 2023 quarter, total revenue increased $989 million, or 8%, due primarily to a 7% increase in capacity and continued strength in travel demand across all geographic regions, particularly for our premium products.\\n\\nSee \\\"Refinery Segment\\\" below for additional details on the refinery's operations, including third party refinery sales.\\n\\n# Passenger Revenue by Geographic Region\\n\\n| |March 2024|Passenger Revenue|RPMs (Traffic)|ASMs (Capacity)|Mile Yield|PRASM|Load Factor|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Domestic|$7,983|5%|5%|2%|—%|3%|2 pts|\\n|Atlantic|$1,305|5%|6%|2%|(1)%|2%|3 pts|\\n|Latin America|$1,265|12%|26%|27%|(12)%|(12)%|— pts|\\n|Pacific|$578|31%|34%|36%|(2)%|(4)%|1 pt|\\n|Total|$11,131|7%|9%|7%|(2)%|—%|2 pts|\\n\\nDomestic passenger revenue increased 5% in the March 2024 quarter compared to the March 2023 quarter on a 2% increase in capacity and two point increase in load factor. We experienced strong revenue results across the domestic network, with coastal hub markets such as New York and Boston improving significantly compared to the prior year period.\\n---\\n# International Passenger Revenue\\n\\nInternational passenger revenue for the March 2024 quarter increased compared to the March 2023 quarter in each geographic region. Passenger unit revenue declined 3% as we continued to invest in rebuilding our Latin and Pacific networks. Strong demand for international travel, particularly to leisure destinations, enabled a one point increase in load factor on a 16% increase in capacity compared to the March 2023 quarter.\\n\\n|Other Revenue|Three Months Ended March 31|Increase|% Increase|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Refinery|$1,185|$916|29%|\\n|Loyalty program|$795|$726|10%|\\n|Ancillary businesses|$180|$231|(22)%|\\n|Miscellaneous|$279|$266|5%|\\n\\nRefinery sales to third parties increased $269 million compared to the March 2023 quarter due to higher sales volume. See \\\"Refinery Segment\\\" below for additional details on the refinery's operations, including third party refinery sales.\\n\\nLoyalty Program revenues increased compared to the March 2023 quarter due to increased co-brand card spend. Revenues are mainly driven by customer spend on American Express cards and new cardholder acquisitions.\\n\\n|Operating Expense|Three Months Ended March 31|Increase|% Increase|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Salaries and related costs|$3,791|$3,386|12%|\\n|Aircraft fuel and related taxes|$2,598|$2,676|(3)%|\\n|Ancillary businesses and refinery|$1,370|$1,125|22%|\\n|Contracted services|$1,024|$1,010|1%|\\n|Landing fees and other rents|$748|$584|28%|\\n|Aircraft maintenance materials and outside repairs|$679|$585|16%|\\n|Depreciation and amortization|$615|$564|9%|\\n---\\n# Regional carrier expense\\n\\n| |2024|2023|Change|Change %|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Passenger commissions and other selling expenses|550|500|50|10%|\\n|Passenger service|413|416|-3|-1%|\\n|Aircraft rent|136|132|4|3%|\\n|Profit sharing|125|72|53|74%|\\n|Pilot agreement and related expenses|-|864|-864|NM|\\n|Other|535|563|-28|-5%|\\n\\nTotal operating expense: $13,134 in 2024, $13,036 in 2023, Change: $98, Change %: 1%\\n\\nSalaries and Related Costs. We implemented a base pay increase for eligible employees of 5% effective April 1, 2023 and on January 1, 2024, Delta pilots received a 5% pay increase. Additionally, we had approximately 5,000 more employees as of March 31, 2024 than at March 31, 2023, principally in in-flight service, flight operations and aircraft maintenance, in order to support our operations. Each of these items contributed to the increase in salaries and related costs during the March 2024 quarter compared to the March 2023 quarter.\\n\\nAircraft Fuel and Related Taxes. Aircraft fuel and related taxes decreased $78 million compared to the March 2023 quarter primarily due to a 15% decrease in the market price of jet fuel partially offset by a 5% increase in consumption on a 7% increase in capacity. The refinery also provided a benefit of five cents per gallon compared to a benefit of 25 cents per gallon in the March 2023 quarter. We expect jet fuel prices to remain volatile.\\n\\nSee \\\"Refinery Segment\\\" below for additional details on the refinery's operations.\\n\\n# Fuel expense and average price per gallon\\n\\n| |2024|2023|Change (Decrease)|2024|2023|Change (Decrease)|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Fuel purchase cost|$2,620|$2,939|($319)|$2.81|$3.31|($0.50)|\\n|Fuel hedge impact|27|(41)|68|0.03|(0.05)|0.08|\\n|Refinery segment impact|(49)|(222)|173|(0.05)|(0.25)|0.20|\\n\\nTotal fuel expense: $2,598 in 2024, $2,676 in 2023, Change: ($78), Average Price Per Gallon: $2.79 in 2024, $3.01 in 2023, Change: ($0.22)\\n\\n(1) Market price for jet fuel at airport locations, including related taxes and transportation costs.\\n\\nAncillary Businesses and Refinery. Ancillary businesses and refinery includes expenses associated with refinery sales to third parties, aircraft maintenance services we provide to third parties and our vacation wholesale operations. Refinery sales to third parties increased $269 million compared to the March 2023 quarter due to higher sales volume. See \\\"Refinery Segment\\\" below for additional details on the refinery's operations, including third party refinery sales.\\n\\nLanding Fees and Other Rents. The increase in landing fees and other rents primarily resulted from higher rates charged by airports following extensive redevelopment projects at numerous facilities and more flights compared to the March 2023 quarter that contributed to our increased capacity.\\n---\\n# Item 2. MD&A - Results of Operations\\n\\nPilot agreement and related expenses. In the March 2023 quarter, Delta pilots ratified a new four-year Pilot Working Agreement effective January 1, 2023. The agreement includes numerous work rule changes and pay rate increases during the four-year term, including an initial pay rate increase of 18%. The agreement also includes a provision for a one-time payment made upon ratification in the March 2023 quarter of $735 million. Additionally, we recorded adjustments to other benefit-related items of approximately $130 million.\\n\\n# Non-Operating Results\\n\\n| |Three Months Ended March 31|Favorable (Unfavorable)|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Interest expense, net|$(205)|$(227)|$22|\\n|Gain/(loss) on investments, net|$(227)|$122|$(349)|\\n|Loss on extinguishment of debt|$(4)|$(22)|$18|\\n|Miscellaneous, net|$(56)|$(102)|$46|\\n\\nTotal non-operating expense, net: $(492) for 2024, $(229) for 2023, $(263) unfavorable\\n\\nInterest expense, net. Interest expense, net includes interest expense and interest income. This decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to reduced interest expense resulting from our debt reduction initiatives. During 2023, we made payments of approximately $4.1 billion related to our debt and finance lease obligations and we have continued to pay down our debt during the three months ended March 31, 2024 with $712 million of payments on debt and finance lease obligations. We continue to seek opportunities to pre-pay our debt, in addition to periodic amortization and scheduled maturities.\\n\\nGain/(loss) on investments, net. Changes in the valuation of investments accounted for at fair value are recorded in gain/(loss) on investments, net and are driven by changes in stock prices, foreign currency fluctuations and other valuation techniques for investments in certain companies, particularly those without publicly-traded shares. See Note 4 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our equity investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis.\\n\\nLoss on extinguishment of debt. Loss on extinguishment of debt reflects the losses incurred in the early repayment of certain loans and notes.\\n\\nMiscellaneous, net. Miscellaneous, net primarily includes employee benefit plans net periodic cost, our share of our equity method investments' results, charitable contributions and foreign exchange gains/(losses).\\n\\n# Income Taxes\\n\\nWe project our annual effective tax rate for 2024 will be between 23% and 25%. In certain periods, we may have adjustments to our net deferred tax liabilities as a result of changes in prior year estimates, mark-to-market adjustments on our equity investments and tax laws enacted during the period, which will impact the effective tax rate for that period.\\n---\\n# Item 2. MD&A - Refinery Segment\\n\\nRefinery Segment\\n\\nThe refinery operated by Monroe primarily produces gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. Monroe exchanges non-jet fuel products the refinery produces with third parties for jet fuel consumed in our airline operations. The jet fuel produced and procured through exchanging gasoline and diesel fuel produced by the refinery typically provides approximately 200,000 barrels per day, or approximately 75% of our consumption, for use in our airline operations. The refinery generated lower operating income in the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023, primarily as a result of lower pricing.\\n\\nFor more information regarding the refinery's results, see Note 9 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.\\n\\n# Refinery segment financial information\\n\\n|(in millions, except per gallon data)|Three Months Ended March 31|Increase (Decrease)|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Exchanged products|$439|$714|($275)|\\n|Sales of refined products|$39|$126|($87)|\\n|Sales to airline segment|$386|$596|($210)|\\n|Third party refinery sales|$1,185|$916|$269|\\n|Operating revenue|$2,049|$2,352|($303)|\\n|Operating income|$49|$222|($173)|\\n|Refinery segment impact on airline average price per fuel gallon|($0.05)|($0.25)|$0.20|\\n\\n# Operating Statistics\\n\\n|Three Months Ended March 31|% Increase (Decrease)|\\n|---|---|\\n|Consolidated(1)|2024|2023|\\n|Revenue passenger miles (in millions) (\\\"RPM\\\")|54,207|49,687|9%|\\n|Available seat miles (in millions) (\\\"ASM\\\")|65,542|61,351|7%|\\n|Passenger mile yield|20.53 ¢|20.95 ¢|(2)%|\\n|Passenger revenue per available seat mile (\\\"PRASM\\\")|16.98 ¢|16.97 ¢|—%|\\n|Total revenue per available seat mile (\\\"TRASM\\\")|20.98 ¢|20.80 ¢|1%|\\n|TRASM, adjusted(2)|19.17 ¢|19.30 ¢|(0.7)%|\\n|Cost per available seat mile (\\\"CASM\\\")|20.04 ¢|21.25 ¢|(6)%|\\n---\\n# CASM-Ex(2)\\n\\n| |14.08 ¢|13.86 ¢|1.5 %|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Passenger load factor|83 %|81 %|2 pts|\\n|Fuel gallons consumed (in millions)|931|888|5 %|\\n\\nAverage price per fuel gallon(3)\\n\\n| |$ 2.79|$ 3.01|(7) %|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Average price per fuel gallon, adjusted(2)(3)|$ 2.76|$ 3.06|(10) %|\\n\\n(1)Includes the operations of our regional carriers under capacity purchase agreements.\\n\\n(2)Non-GAAP financial measures defined and reconciled to TRASM, CASM and average fuel price per gallon, respectively, in \\\"Supplemental Information\\\" below.\\n\\n(3)Includes the impact of fuel hedge activity and refinery segment results.\\n\\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. | March 2024 Form 10-Q\\n\\n# Item 2.

MD&A - Financial Condition and Liquidity\\n\\nFinancial Condition and Liquidity\\n\\nAs of March 31, 2024, we had $7.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and aggregate undrawn principal amount available under our revolving credit facilities. We expect to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months with cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash flows from operations. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity needs with cash flows from operations and financing arrangements.\\n\\nUndrawn Lines of Credit. As of March 31, 2024, we had approximately $2.9 billion undrawn and available under our revolving credit facilities.\\n\\nSources and Uses of Liquidity\\n\\nOperating Activities\\n\\nWe generated cash flows from operations of $2.4 billion and $2.2 billion in the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We expect to continue generating positive cash flows from operations during the remainder of 2024.\\n\\nOur operating cash flow is impacted by the following factors:\\n\\nSeasonality of Advance Ticket Sales. We sell tickets for air travel in advance of the customer's travel date. When we receive a cash payment at the time of sale, we record the cash received on advance sales as deferred revenue in air traffic liability. The air traffic liability typically increases during the winter and spring months as advance ticket sales grow prior to the summer peak travel season and decreases during the summer and fall months.\\n---\\nFuel. Fuel expense represented approximately 20% and 21% of our total operating expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The market price for jet fuel is volatile, which can impact the comparability of our periodic cash flows from operations. The market price for jet fuel was lower in the March quarter 2024 compared to the March quarter 2023. Fuel consumption was higher during the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the prior year period due to the increase in capacity. We continue to expect that fuel consumption for the full year 2024 will increase compared to 2023 aligned with capacity, partially offset by increases in the fuel efficiency of our fleet.\\n\\nProfit Sharing. We paid $1.4 billion in profit sharing payments in February 2024 related to our 2023 pre-tax profit in recognition of our employees' contributions toward achieving the year's financial results. This is an increase compared to our profit sharing payment made in February 2023, where we paid $563 million in profit sharing related to our 2022 pre-tax profit.\\n\\nOur broad-based employee profit sharing program provides that for each year in which we have an annual pre-tax profit, as defined by the terms of the program, we will pay a specified portion of that profit to eligible employees. In determining the amount of profit sharing, the program defines profit as pre-tax profit adjusted for profit sharing and certain other items. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we accrued $125 million in profit sharing expense based on the year-to-date performance and current expectations for 2024 profit.\\n\\nSale of Miles to Participating Companies. Customers earn miles based on their spending with participating companies such as credit card, retail, ridesharing, car rental and hotel companies with which we have marketing agreements to sell miles. Payments are typically due to us monthly based on the volume of miles sold during the period. Our most significant contract to sell miles relates to our co-brand credit card relationship with American Express. Total cash sales to American Express were $1.7 billion in the three months ended March 31, 2024, an increase of 5% compared to the prior year period. See Note 2 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the cash sales from marketing agreements.\\n\\nDelta Air Lines, Inc.\\nMarch 2024 Form 10-Q\\n23\\nItem 2. MD&A - Financial Condition and Liquidity Investing Activities\\n\\nShort-Term Investments. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we redeemed a net of $546 million in short-term investments. See Note 3 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on these investments.\\n\\nCapital Expenditures. Our capital expenditures were $1.2 billion and $1.0 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We have committed to future aircraft purchases and have obtained, but are under no obligation to use, long-term financing commitments for a substantial portion of the purchase price of the aircraft. Our expected 2024 capital spend of approximately $5.0 billion, excluding the New York-LaGuardia airport project discussed below, will be primarily for aircraft, including deliveries and advance deposit payments, as well as fleet modifications and technology enhancements and may vary depending on financing decisions.\\n\\nNew York-LaGuardia Redevelopment. As part of the terminal redevelopment project at LaGuardia Airport, we are partnering with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to replace Terminals C and D with a new state-of-the-art terminal facility. Construction is ongoing with completion expected by the end of 2024.\\n\\nUsing funding primarily provided by existing financing arrangements and other sources of funding, we expect to spend approximately $400 million on this project during 2024, of which $93 million was incurred in the three months ended March 31, 2024.\\n---\\n# Financing Activities\\n\\nDebt and Finance Leases. In the three months ended March 31, 2024, we had cash outflows of $712 million related to repayments of our debt and finance lease obligations. We continue to seek opportunities to pre-pay our debt, in addition to periodic amortization and scheduled maturities.\\n\\nIn February 2024, Moody's credit rating agency affirmed our credit rating and upgraded its outlook for Delta to positive.\\n\\nCapital Return to Shareholders. In the March 2024 quarter, the Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share, which we paid on March 18, 2024 for total cash dividends of $64 million.\\n\\nCovenants. We were in compliance with the covenants in our debt agreements at March 31, 2024.\\n\\n# Critical Accounting Estimates\\n\\nThere have been no material changes in our Critical Accounting Estimates from the information provided in the \\\"Critical Accounting Estimates\\\" section of \\\"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\\\" in our Form 10-K. Delta Air Lines, Inc. | March 2024 Form 10-Q 24\\n\\n# Item 2. MD&A - Supplemental Information\\n\\nSupplemental Information\\n\\nWe sometimes use information (non-GAAP financial measures) that is derived from the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, but that is not presented in accordance with GAAP. Under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules, non-GAAP financial measures may be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to GAAP results.\\n\\nIncluded below are reconciliations of non-GAAP measures used within this Form 10-Q to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations below may not calculate exactly due to rounding. These reconciliations include certain adjustments to GAAP measures to provide comparability between the reported periods, if applicable, and for the reasons indicated below:\\n\\n|Third-party refinery sales.|Refinery sales to third parties, and related expenses, are not related to our airline segment. Excluding these sales therefore provides a more meaningful comparison of our airline operations to the rest of the airline industry.|\\n|---|---|\\n|MTM adjustments and settlements on hedges.|Mark-to-market (\\\"MTM\\\") adjustments are defined as fair value changes recorded in periods other than the settlement period. Such fair value changes are not necessarily indicative of the actual settlement value of the underlying hedge in the contract settlement period, and therefore we remove this impact to allow investors to better understand and analyze our core performance. Settlements represent cash received or paid on hedge contracts settled during the applicable period.|\\n|One-time pilot agreement expenses.|In the March 2023 quarter, Delta pilots ratified a new four-year Pilot Working Agreement effective January 1, 2023. The agreement includes numerous work rule changes and pay rate increases during the four-year term, including an initial pay rate increase of 18%. The agreement also includes a provision for a one-time payment made upon ratification in the March 2023 quarter of $735 million. Additionally, we recorded adjustments to other benefit-related items of approximately $130 million. Adjusting for these expenses allows investors to better understand and analyze our core cost performance.|\\n---\\n# Aircraft fuel and related taxes\\n\\nThe volatility in fuel prices impacts the comparability of year-over-year financial performance. The adjustment for aircraft fuel and related taxes allows investors to better understand and analyze our non-fuel costs and year-over-year financial performance.\\n\\n# Profit sharing\\n\\nWe adjust for profit sharing because this adjustment allows investors to better understand and analyze our recurring cost performance and provides a more meaningful comparison of our core operating costs to the airline industry.\\n\\n# Total revenue, adjusted reconciliation\\n\\n|(in millions)|Three Months Ended March 31,|2024|2023|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Total revenue|$13,748|$12,759| |\\n|Adjusted for:| | | |\\n|Third-party refinery sales|($1,185)|($916)| |\\n|Total revenue, adjusted|$12,563|$11,842| |\\n\\n# Operating expense, adjusted reconciliation\\n\\n|(in millions)|Three Months Ended March 31,|2024|2023|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Operating expense|$13,134|$13,036| |\\n|Adjusted for:| | | |\\n|MTM adjustments and settlements on hedges|($27)|$41| |\\n|Third-party refinery sales|($1,185)|($916)| |\\n|One-time pilot agreement expenses| |($864)| |\\n|Operating expense, adjusted|$11,923|$11,296| |\\n\\n# Fuel expense, adjusted reconciliation\\n\\n|(in millions, except per gallon data)|Three Months Ended March 31, 2024|Three Months Ended March 31, 2023|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Total fuel expense|$2,598|$2,676|$2.79|$3.01|\\n|Adjusted for:| | |\\n|MTM adjustments and settlements on hedges|($27)|$41|($0.03)|$0.05|\\n\\nDelta Air Lines, Inc. | March 2024 Form 10-Q\\n---\\n# Total fuel expense, adjusted\\n\\n| |2024|2023|2.76|3.06|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| | | |$|2,571|2,718|\\n\\n# TRASM, adjusted reconciliation\\n\\n| |Three Months Ended March 31, 2024|Three Months Ended March 31, 2023|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|TRASM (cents)|20.98 ¢|20.80 ¢|\\n|Adjusted for:| | |\\n|Third-party refinery sales|(1.81)|(1.49)|\\n|TRASM, adjusted|19.17 ¢|19.30 ¢|\\n\\n# CASM-Ex reconciliation\\n\\n| |Three Months Ended March 31, 2024|Three Months Ended March 31, 2023|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|CASM (cents)|20.04 ¢|21.25 ¢|\\n|Adjusted for:| | |\\n|Aircraft fuel and related taxes|(3.96)|(4.36)|\\n|Third-party refinery sales|(1.81)|(1.49)|\\n|Profit sharing|(0.19)|(0.12)|\\n|One-time pilot agreement expenses| |(1.41)|\\n|CASM-Ex|14.08 ¢|13.86 ¢|\\n\\n# Item 2.

We present free cash flow because management believes this metric is helpful to investors to evaluate the company's ability to generate cash that is available for use for debt service or general corporate initiatives. Adjustments include:\\n\\n- Net redemptions of short-term investments. Net redemptions of short-term investments represent the net purchase and sale activity of investments and marketable securities in the period, including gains and losses. We adjust for this activity to provide investors a better understanding of the company's free cash flow generated by our operations.\\n- Net cash flows related to certain airport construction projects and other. Cash flows related to certain airport construction projects are included in our GAAP operating activities and capital expenditures.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited)\\n\\n1. General\\n\\nBusiness and Basis of Presentation\\n\\nHawaiian Holdings, Inc. (Holdings) and its direct wholly owned subsidiary, Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. (Hawaiian), are incorporated in the State of Delaware. Holdings’ primary asset is its sole ownership of all issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Hawaiian. References to the \\\"Company\\\", \\\"we\\\", \\\"us\\\", and \\\"our\\\" in these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements include both Holdings and Hawaiian unless the context requires otherwise.\\n\\nThe accompanying unaudited financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Accordingly, these interim financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the accompanying financial statements contain all adjustments, including normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of the Company’s results of operations and financial position for the periods presented. Due to seasonal variations in the demand for air travel, among other factors common to the airline industry, the results of operations for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for the entire year. The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes of the Company included in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\\n\\nUnless otherwise noted, all amounts disclosed are stated before consideration of income taxes.\\n---\\n# Merger Agreement with Alaska Air Group\\n\\nOn December 2, 2023, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) with Alaska Air Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (Alaska), and Marlin Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Alaska (Merger Sub), pursuant to which, subject to satisfaction or waiver of conditions therein, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the Merger), with the Company surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Alaska.\\n\\nAt the effective time of the Merger (the Effective Time), each share of the Company's common stock, Series B Special Preferred Stock, Series C Special Preferred Stock, and Series D Special Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to certain customary exceptions specified in the Merger Agreement, will be converted into the right to receive $18.00 per share, payable to the holder in cash, without interest.\\n\\nCompletion of the Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by the Company's stockholders, which was obtained on February 16, 2024; performance by the parties in all material respects of all their obligations under the Merger Agreement; the receipt of required regulatory approvals; and the absence of an order or law preventing, materially restraining, or materially impairing the consummation of the Merger.\\n\\nOn February 7, 2024, the Company and Alaska each received a request for additional information and documentary material (together, the Second Request) from the Department of Justice (the DOJ) in connection with the DOJ’s review of the Merger. On March 27, 2024, the Company and Alaska entered into a timing agreement with the DOJ pursuant to which we agreed, among other things, not to consummate the Merger before 90 days following the date on which both parties have certified substantial compliance with the Second Request unless we have received written notice from the DOJ prior to the end of such 90-day period that the DOJ has closed its investigation of the Merger.\\n\\nThe Merger Agreement includes customary termination rights in favor of each party. In certain circumstances, the Company may be required to pay Alaska a termination fee of $39.6 million in connection with the termination of the Merger Agreement. The Merger is expected to close within 12 to 18 months of the date of the Merger Agreement.\\n\\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company incurred $8.5 million and $0.0 million, respectively, of costs related to the Merger Agreement, which was recorded as a Special item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\\n\\n# Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\\n\\nReclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) by component are as follows:\\n\\n|Details about accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) components|Three months ended March 31, 2024|Three months ended March 31, 2023|Affected line items in the consolidated statements of operations where net income is presented|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Amortization of defined benefit plan items|$290|$450|Nonoperating income (expense), other, net|\\n|Actuarial loss|$173|$145|Nonoperating income (expense), other, net|\\n---\\n# Total before tax\\n\\n463\\n595\\n\\n# Tax benefit\\n\\n(114)\\n(147)\\n\\n# Total, net of tax\\n\\n$349\\n$448\\n\\n# Short-term investments\\n\\n| |Realized gain on sales of investments| |\\n|---|---|---|\\n| |$ (79)|$ (393)|\\n| |Gains (losses) on investments, net| |\\n| | | |\\n| |Realized loss on sales of investments| |\\n| |30|911|\\n| |Gains (losses) on investments, net| |\\n| | | |\\n\\n# Total before tax\\n\\n(49)\\n518\\n\\n# Income tax expense\\n\\n12\\n128\\n\\n# Total, net of tax\\n\\n$(37)\\n$646\\n\\n# Total reclassifications for the period\\n\\n$312\\n$1,094\\n\\n# A roll-forward of the amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 is as follows:\\n\\n| |Defined Benefit|Short-Term Investments|Total|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n| |Three months ended March 31, 2024| | |\\n| |(in thousands)| | |\\n|Beginning balance|$(60,677)|$(18,475)|$(79,152)|\\n|Other comprehensive income before reclassifications, net of tax|1|804|805|\\n|Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax|349|$(37)|312|\\n|Net current-period other comprehensive income|350|767|1,117|\\n|Ending balance|$(60,327)|$(17,708)|$(78,035)|\\n\\n| |Defined Benefit|Short-Term Investments|Total|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n| |Three months ended March 31, 2023| | |\\n| |(in thousands)| | |\\n|Beginning balance|$(59,439)|$(35,727)|$(95,166)|\\n|Other comprehensive income (loss) before reclassifications, net of tax|$(7,526)|4,380|$(3,146)|\\n|Amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax|448|646|1,094|\\n|Net current-period other comprehensive income (loss)|$(7,078)|5,026|$(2,052)|\\n|Ending balance|$(66,517)|$(30,701)|$(97,218)|\\n---\\n# Basic Loss Per Share\\n\\nBasic loss per share, which excludes dilution, is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.\\n\\nThe potentially dilutive shares that were excluded from the computation of diluted weighted average common stock shares outstanding because their effect would have been antidilutive was 705,999 and 95,819 for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Certain warrant shares held by Amazon have not been included in the computation as their performance condition has not yet been satisfied. As of March 31, 2024 and 2023, the unvested Amazon warrant shares excluded from antidilutive shares were 8,183,451 for both periods. Refer to Note 11 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.\\n\\n# Computation of Basic and Diluted Loss Per Share\\n\\n| |Three Months Ended March 31,|2024|2023|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Numerator:| |(in thousands, except for per share data)| |\\n|Net Loss|$ (137,565)|$ (98,257)| |\\n|Denominator:| | | |\\n|Weighted average common stock shares outstanding - Basic| |51,838|51,507|\\n|Dilutive effect of share-based awards and warrants| |-|-|\\n|Weighted average common stock shares outstanding - Diluted| |51,838|51,507|\\n|Net Loss Per Share| | | |\\n|Basic|$ (2.65)|$ (1.91)| |\\n| | |Diluted|$ (2.65)|$ (1.91)|\\n\\n# Revenue Recognition\\n\\nThe majority of the Company's passenger revenue is derived from passenger ticket sales. Other revenue is primarily derived from the Company's cargo operations and loyalty program. The Company's primary operations are that of its wholly owned subsidiary, Hawaiian. Principally all operations of Hawaiian either originate and/or end in the state of Hawai'i. The management of such operations is based on a system-wide approach due to the interdependence of Hawaiian's route structure in its various markets. As Hawaiian offers only one significant line of business (i.e., air transportation), management has concluded that it has only one segment. The Company's operating revenues by geographic region (as defined by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT)) are summarized below:\\n\\n| |Three Months Ended March 31,|2024|2023|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Geographic Information| |(in thousands)| |\\n|Domestic|$ 492,410|$ 486,129| |\\n|Pacific|$ 153,157|$ 126,474| |\\n---\\n# Total operating revenue\\n\\n| |2024|2023|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Total operating revenue|$645,567|$612,603|\\n\\nHawaiian attributes operating revenue by geographic region based on the destination of each flight segment. Hawaiian's tangible assets consist primarily of flight equipment, which is mobile across geographic markets, and therefore has not been allocated to specific geographic regions. Other operating revenue consists of cargo revenue, commissions, and fees earned under certain joint marketing agreements with other companies. These amounts are recognized when the service is provided.\\n\\n| |Three Months Ended March 31|\\n|---|---|\\n| |2024|2023|\\n|Passenger Revenue by Type (in thousands)| | |\\n|Passenger revenue, excluding frequent flyer|$539,622|$505,962|\\n|Frequent flyer revenue, transportation component|$43,826|$42,564|\\n|Passenger Revenue|$583,448|$548,526|\\n|Other revenue (e.g., cargo and other miscellaneous)|$33,547|$35,139|\\n|Frequent flyer revenue, marketing and brand component|$28,572|$28,938|\\n|Other Revenue|$62,119|$64,077|\\n\\nAs of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company's air traffic liability balance, as it relates to passenger tickets (excluding frequent flyer liability), was $539.1 million and $423.1 million, respectively, which generally represents revenue that is expected to be realized in future periods.\\n\\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the amount of passenger ticket revenue recognized that was included in Air traffic liability as of the beginning of the respective period was $250.2 million and $294.5 million, respectively.\\n\\nNon-refundable tickets sold and credits issued generally expire 13 months from the date of issuance or scheduled flight, as applicable. The Company records an estimate of breakage revenue on the scheduled flight date for tickets that will expire unused. These estimates are based on the evaluation of actual historical results, available market information, and forecasted trends, including weather or other events impacting customer travel.

If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, the Company will evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, the Company employs a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of its investments. In addition, the Company considers specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If the Company has plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is recorded as an impairment charge in Other, net, within non-operating expense on the unaudited consolidated statements of operations, and a new cost basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee conditions deteriorate, the Company may incur future impairments.\\n\\nDebt securities in a continuous unrealized loss position for twelve months or greater as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were primarily attributable to changes in interest rates, relative to when the investment securities were purchased. The Company does not intend to sell any of these investments and it is not more likely than not that it will be required to sell any of these investments before recovery of the entire amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity. Accordingly, the Company has determined that the unrealized losses on its debt securities as of March 31, 2024 were temporary in nature. The Company has evaluated these debt securities and did not recognize any significant credit losses as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\\n\\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the unrealized gains on equity securities, recorded in Gains on Investment, net, in Nonoperating income (expense) were $5.1 million and $0.9 million, respectively.\\n\\nContractual maturities of debt securities as of March 31, 2024 are shown below:\\n\\n| |Under 1 Year|1 to 5 Years|Over 5 Years|Total|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Corporate debt|$ 132|$ 66,935|$ 82,021|$ 149,088|\\n|U.S. government and agency debt|$ 7,109|$ 284,695|$ 13,270|$ 305,074|\\n|Other fixed income securities|$ 425|$ 14,410|$ 13,780|$ 28,615|\\n|Asset-backed securities|$ 305|$ 9,627|$ 18,620|$ 28,552|\\n---\\n# Collateralized loan obligations\\n\\n35,495\\n35,495\\n\\n# Bank notes\\n\\n4,489\\n4,001\\n8,490\\n\\n# Total debt securities\\n\\n$ 7,971\\n$ 380,156\\n$ 167,187\\n$ 555,314\\n\\nThe Company classifies its investments as current assets as these securities are available for use in its current operation.\\n\\n# 7. Fair Value Measurements\\n\\nAccounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement (ASC 820), defines fair value as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, ASC 820 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:\\n\\n- Level 1 — Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\\n- Level 2 — Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term for the assets or liabilities; and\\n- Level 3 — Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\\n\\nThe tables below present the Company’s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\\n\\n# Fair Value Measurements as of March 31, 2024\\n\\n| |Total|Level 1|Level 2|Level 3|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Cash equivalents|$ 139,427|$ 138,084|$ 1,343|$ —|\\n|Restricted cash|17,250|17,250|—|—|\\n\\n# Short-term investments\\n\\n| | |Debt securities| |\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n| | |Corporate debt securities|149,088|—|144,526|4,562|\\n| | |U.S. government and agency securities|305,074|—|305,074|—|\\n| | |Other fixed income securities|28,615|—|28,615|—|\\n| | |Asset-backed securities|28,552|—|20,768|7,784|\\n| | |Collateralized loan obligations|35,495|—|35,029|466|\\n| | |Bank notes|8,490|—|1,692|6,798|\\n| | |Total debt securities|555,314|—|535,704|19,610|\\n---\\n|Assets|Total|Level 1|Level 2|Level 3|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Cash equivalents|$99,965|$99,279|$686|$—|\\n|Restricted cash|$17,250|$17,250|$—|$—|\\n|Short-term investments| | | | |\\n|Debt securities| | | | |\\n|Corporate debt securities|$207,500|$—|$202,873|$4,627|\\n|U.S. government and agency securities|$300,429|$—|$300,429|$—|\\n|Other fixed income securities|$28,514|$—|$28,514|$—|\\n|Asset-backed securities|$23,086|$—|$15,172|$7,914|\\n|Collateralized loan obligations|$38,376|$—|$38,123|$253|\\n|Bank notes|$8,914|$—|$2,046|$6,868|\\n|Total debt securities|$606,819|$—|$587,157|$19,662|\\n|Derivatives|$514|$—|$514|$—|\\n|Equity securities|$146,811|$146,031|$780|$—|\\n|Other investments measured at net asset value|$1,080|$—|$—|$—|\\n|Total short-term investments|$755,224|$146,031|$588,451|$19,662|\\n|Other Assets| | | | |\\n|Fuel derivative contracts|$2,069|$—|$2,069|$—|\\n|Assets held-for-sale|$1,135|$—|$—|$1,135|\\n---\\n# Total assets measured at fair value\\n\\n| |March 31, 2024|March 31, 2023|December 31, 2023|March 31, 2022|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Cash equivalents and restricted cash|$875,643|$262,560|$591,206|$20,797|\\n\\nThe Company's Level 1 cash equivalents consist of money market securities and mutual funds, which are valued based on quoted prices in an active market. The carrying amounts approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these assets. Level 2 cash equivalents consist primarily of debt securities with original maturity dates less than 90 days. The fair value of these instruments is based on a market approach using prices generated by market transactions involving similar assets. Restricted cash includes funds held in a controlled account to be used for debt service payments associated with the Company's loyalty and intellectual brand offering. As of March 31, 2024, approximately $17.3 million was held in the controlled account designated for debt servicing and was classified as restricted cash on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.\\n\\nThe Company's Level 1 short-term investments consist of equity mutual funds, which are valued based on a market approach using prices generated by market transactions involving identical assets. Level 2 short-term investments consist of corporate debt securities, U.S. government and agency securities, other fixed income securities, asset-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations, bank notes, equity securities, and derivative instruments as further discussed in Note 8, which are valued based on a market approach using industry standard valuation techniques that incorporate inputs such as quoted prices for similar assets, interest rates, benchmark curves, credit ratings, and other observable inputs or market data. Certain asset-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations, and private bank notes that are not readily marketable are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy and valued using certain unobservable inputs including future cash flows and discount rates.\\n\\n# Short-term Investment Activity for the three months ended March 31, 2024\\n\\n| |Asset-Backed Securities|Bank Notes|Collateralized Loan Obligations|Corporate Debt Securities|Total|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Beginning balance as of December 31, 2023 (in thousands)|$7,914|$6,868|$253|$4,627|$19,662|\\n|Purchases|-|-|$213|-|$213|\\n|Sale of investments|-|-|-|($10)|($10)|\\n|Redemptions and paydowns|($39)|($72)|-|-|($111)|\\n|Amortization and accretion, net|$29|-|-|($68)|($39)|\\n|Realized and unrealized gains (losses), net|($120)|$2|-|$13|($105)|\\n|Ending balance as of March 31, 2024|$7,784|$6,798|$466|$4,562|$19,610|\\n\\n# Short-term Investment Activity for the three months ended March 31, 2023\\n---\\n# Collateralized Asset-Backed Loan Corporate Securities Bank Notes Obligations Debt Securities Total\\n\\n| |Beginning balance as of December 31, 2022 (in thousands)|\\n|---|---|\\n|Securities|$9,033|\\n|Bank Notes|$9,426|\\n|Obligations|$2,558|\\n|Debt Securities|$8,173|\\n|Total|$29,190|\\n\\n| |March 31, 2023|\\n|---|---|\\n|Securities|$8,863|\\n|Bank Notes|$8,058|\\n|Obligations|$2,428|\\n|Debt Securities|$8,217|\\n|Total|$27,566|\\n\\nOther investments at net asset value (NAV). In accordance with relevant accounting standards, certain investments that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in the table above are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented in the statement of financial position. The investments measured using NAV are investments in a partnership for which a secondary market does not exist. Investments in the partnership are carried at estimated NAV as determined by and reported by the general partners of the partnerships and represent the proportionate share of the estimated fair value of the underlying assets of the limited partnerships. The Company can redeem its shares upon approval by the respective partnerships' managing member.\\n\\nFuel derivative contracts. The Company uses derivatives to manage risks associated with certain assets and liabilities arising from the potential adverse impact of fluctuations in global fuel prices. The Company’s operations are inherently dependent upon the price and availability of aircraft fuel. To manage economic risks associated with fluctuations in aircraft fuel prices, the Company periodically enters into derivative financial instruments. Any changes in fair value of these derivative instruments are adjusted through other Nonoperating income (expense) in the period of change. The Company’s fuel derivative contracts consist of crude oil call options, which are not traded on a public exchange. The fair value of these instruments is determined based on inputs available or derived from public markets including contractual terms, market prices, yield curves, and measures of volatility among others.\\n\\nAssets held for sale. The Company's assets held for sale consist of aircraft, engine, rotable and expendable aircraft parts. The assets are measured at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell and a loss is recognized for any initial adjustment of the assets' carrying amount to fair value less cost to sell. The fair value measurements for the Company's held-for-sale assets were based on Level 3 inputs, which include information obtained from third-party valuation sources and other market sources, including recent offers from potential buyers. Refer to Note 13 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.\\n\\n# Fair Value of Debt\\n\\n| |March 31, 2024|December 31, 2023|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Carrying|Fair Value|Carrying|Fair Value|\\n---\\n# Amount Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Amount Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3\\n\\n| |Amount|Total|Level 1|Level 2|Level 3|Amount|Total|Level 1|Level 2|Level 3|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|(in thousands)|$ 1,687,367|$ 1,526,555|$ —|$ —|$ 1,526,555|$ 1,581,009|$ 1,406,721|$ —|$ —|$ 1,406,721|\\n\\nThe fair value estimates of the Company’s debt were based on the discounted amount of future cash flows using the Company’s current incremental rate of borrowing based on quotes of similar debt for other similarly rated companies.\\n\\nThe carrying amounts of cash, other receivables, and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these financial instruments.\\n\\n# Financial Derivative Instruments\\n\\nThe Company uses derivatives to manage risks associated with certain assets and liabilities arising from the potential adverse impact of fluctuations in global fuel prices.\\n\\nFuel Risk Management\\n\\nThe Company's operations are inherently dependent upon the price and availability of aircraft fuel. To manage economic risks associated with fluctuations in aircraft fuel prices, the Company periodically enters into derivative financial instruments. The Company uses a combination of derivative contracts to hedge its aircraft fuel expense. The following table reflects the amount of realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded as Nonoperating income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\\n\\n|Fuel derivative contracts|Three months ended March 31|2024|2023|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n| | |(in thousands)| | |\\n|Losses realized at settlement|$ (2,398)|$ (1,513)| |\\n|Reversal of prior period unrealized amounts|$ 4,335|$ 2,639| |\\n|Unrealized losses that will settle in future periods|$ (2,519)|$ (6,191)| |\\n|Losses on fuel derivatives recorded as Nonoperating Expense|$ (582)|$ (5,065)| |\\n\\nInvestment Portfolio Management\\n\\nThe Company's investment managers use a combination of derivative instruments (swaps, futures, options and forward contracts) to manage risk associated with its investment portfolio, including the volatility in interest rates and currency exchange rates on foreign denominated debt securities. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the Company's derivative positions reflected a net asset position of $1.5 million and $0.5 million, respectively, within the portfolio. During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, the Company recognized a net realized and unrealized gain of $0.6 million and a net realized and unrealized loss of $0.1 million, respectively, through Nonoperating income (expense).\\n\\nThe following table presents the gross fair value of asset and liability derivatives, all of which are not designated as hedging instruments under ASC 815, as well as the net derivative positions and location of the asset and liability balances within the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\\n---\\n# Derivative positions as of March 31, 2024\\n\\n|Balance Sheet Location|Notional Amount (in thousands)|Final Maturity Date|Gross Fair Value of Assets (in thousands)|Gross Fair Value of (Liabilities) (in thousands)|Net Derivative Position|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Fuel derivative contracts Prepaid expenses and other|93,114 gallons|March 2025|$3,189|$—|$3,189|\\n|Foreign currency derivatives Short-term investments|37,707 Euro|March 2025|$1,109|$—|$1,109|\\n|Interest rate contracts Short-term investments|47,217 US Dollars|May 2028|$550|$(152)|$398|\\n\\n# Derivative positions as of December 31, 2023\\n\\n|Balance Sheet Location|Notional Amount (in thousands)|Final Maturity Date|Gross Fair Value of Assets (in thousands)|Gross Fair Value of (Liabilities) (in thousands)|Net Derivative Position|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Fuel derivative contracts Prepaid expenses and other|90,258 gallons|December 2024|$2,069|$—|$2,069|\\n|Foreign currency derivatives Short-term investments|38,385 Euro|March 2025|$543|$(569)|$(26)|\\n|Interest rate contracts Short-term investments|16,110 US Dollars|May 2028|$797|$(257)|$540|\\n|Risk and Collateral investments| | | | | |\\n\\nThe financial derivative instruments expose the Company to possible credit loss in the event the counterparties to the agreements fail to meet their obligations. To manage such credit risks, the Company (1) selects its counterparties based on past experience and credit ratings, (2) limits its exposure to any single counterparty, and (3) periodically monitors the market position and credit rating of each counterparty. Credit risk is deemed to have a minimal impact on the fair value of the derivative instruments as cash collateral would be provided to or by the counterparties based on the current market exposure of the derivative.\\n\\nThe Company's agreements with its counterparties also require the posting of cash collateral in the event the aggregate value of the Company's positions exceeds certain exposure thresholds. The aggregate fair value of the Company's derivative instruments that contain credit-risk related contingent features was in a net asset position of $4.7 million and $2.6 million as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\\n\\nASC 815 requires a reporting entity to elect a policy of whether to offset rights to reclaim cash collateral or obligations to return cash collateral against derivative assets and liabilities executed with the same counterparty under a master netting agreement, or present such amounts on a gross basis. The Company's accounting policy is to present its derivative assets and liabilities on a net basis, including any collateral posted with the counterparty. The Company had no collateral with its counterparties as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\\n---\\n# The Company is also subject to market risk in the event these financial instruments become less valuable in the market. However, changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments will generally offset the change in the fair value of the hedged item, limiting the Company's overall exposure.\\n\\n| |March 31, 2024|December 31, 2023|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Class A EETC-13, fixed interest rate of 3.9%, semiannual principal and interest payments, remaining balance due at maturity in January 2026|$153,067|$162,953|\\n|Japanese Yen denominated financing, fixed interest rate of 1.05%, quarterly principal and interest payments, remaining balance due at maturity in May 2030|17,092|19,050|\\n|Japanese Yen denominated financing, fixed interest rate of 1.01%, semiannual principal and interest payments, remaining balance due at maturity in June 2030|15,278|16,394|\\n|Japanese Yen denominated financing, fixed interest rate of 0.65%, quarterly principal and interest payments, remaining balance due at maturity in March 2025|38,610|45,107|\\n|Japanese Yen denominated financing, fixed interest rate of 0.76%, semiannual principal and interest payments, remaining balance due at maturity in September 2031|40,462|46,225|\\n|CARES Act Payroll Support Program, fixed interest rate of 1.0% for the first through fifth years and variable interest of SOFR plus a margin of 2.0% for the sixth year through maturity, semiannual interest payments, principal balance due at maturity in April 2030 through September 2030|60,278|60,278|\\n|Payroll Support Program Extension, fixed interest rate of 1.0% for the first through fifth years and variable interest of SOFR plus a margin of 2.0% for the sixth year through maturity, semiannual interest payments, principal balance due at maturity in March 2031 through April 2031|27,797|27,797|\\n|Payroll Support Program 3, fixed interest rate of 1.0% for the first through fifth years and variable interest of SOFR plus a margin of 2.0% for the sixth year through maturity, semiannual interest payments, principal balance due at maturity in April 2031 through June 2031|23,908|23,908|\\n|Financing Lease, variable interest rate of SOFR plus a margin of 3.85%, quarterly principal and interest payments, remaining balance due at maturity in January 2034|131,400|—|\\n|Loyalty Program Financing, fixed interest of 5.75%, quarterly interest payments, principal balance due at maturity in January 2026|1,200,000|1,200,000|\\n|Unamortized debt discount and issuance costs|($20,525)|($20,703)|\\n---\\n# Total Debt\\n\\n| |Amount| |\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Total Debt|$1,687,367|$1,581,009|\\n|Less: Current maturities of long-term debt|($75,132)|($43,857)|\\n|Long-Term Debt, less discount|$1,612,235|$1,537,152|\\n\\n# Revolving Credit Facility\\n\\nIn August 2022, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit and Guarantee Agreement (the Revolving Credit Facility). The Revolving Credit Facility has an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $235.0 million and matures in December 2025. The Company may, from time to time, grant liens on certain eligible account receivables, aircraft, spare engines, ground support equipment and route authorities, as well as cash and certain cash equivalents, in order to secure its outstanding obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility. Indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest, at a per annum rate based on, at the Company's option: (1) a variable rate equal to the Secured overnight financing rate (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility) plus a margin of 3.0%; or (2) Alternate base rate (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility) plus a margin of 2.0%.

(Amazon), entered into an Air Transportation Services Agreement (the ATSA) under which the Company will provide certain air cargo transportation services to Customer for an initial term of eight years. Thereafter, the Customer may elect to extend the ATSA for two years and, at the end of such period, the parties may mutually agree to extend the term for three additional years.\\n\\nThe ATSA provides for the Company to initially operate ten A330-300F aircraft for air cargo transportation services, with the Customer having the right to enter into work orders for additional aircraft. The Company will supply flight crews, perform maintenance and certain administrative functions, and procure aircraft insurance. The Customer will pay the Company a fixed monthly fee per aircraft, a per flight hour fee, and a per flight cycle fee for each flight cycle operated.

In October 2018, the Company entered into a definitive agreement for the selection of GEnx engines to power its Boeing 787-9 fleet. The agreement provides for the purchase of 20 GEnx engines, the right to purchase an additional 20 GEnx engines, and the purchase of up to four spare engines.\\n\\nIn December 2022, the Company entered into a supplemental agreement to its Boeing 787-9 purchase agreement, pursuant to which (a) the Company agreed with Boeing to defer the delivery of the Boeing 787-9 aircraft and (b) agreed to exercise purchase options for an additional two Boeing 787-9 aircraft. In July 2023, the Company was notified by Boeing that its 2023 and 2024 Boeing 787-9 aircraft deliveries would be delayed by a couple of months. In February 2024, the Company took delivery of its first Boeing 787-9 aircraft under a finance lease. Refer to Note 9\\n---\\nof the Notes to Consolidated Finance Statements for additional discussion. This aircraft was placed into revenue service in April 2024.\\n\\nThe Company took delivery of its second Boeing 787-9 aircraft in April 2024, which is anticipated to enter into revenue service in May 2024. To finance the aircraft, the Company entered into (a) a $115.0 million senior note maturing in April 2034 with a variable interest rate based on SOFR plus 350 basis points, and (b) a $15.0 million junior note maturing in April 2029 with a fixed interest rate of 8.8693%. Principal and interest payments on the notes are due quarterly. In order to complete the purchase of these aircraft and fund related costs, the Company may need to secure acceptable financing. Financing may be necessary to satisfy the Company's capital commitments for firm order aircraft and other related capital expenditures. The Company can provide no assurance that any financing not already in place for aircraft and spare engine deliveries will be available to us on acceptable terms when necessary or at all.\\n\\nThe Company has commitments with third-party service providers for reservations, information technology, and accounting services through 2033. Committed capital and other expenditures include escalation and variable amounts based on estimated forecasts. The gross committed expenditures and committed payments as of March 31, 2024 and for the next five fiscal years and thereafter are detailed below:\\n\\n|Aircraft and Aircraft Related|Other|Total Committed Expenditures|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Remaining in 2024|$225,949|$20,204|$246,153|\\n|2025|$419,557|$18,328|$437,885|\\n|2026|$665,473|$12,085|$677,558|\\n|2027|$252,872|$8,270|$261,142|\\n|2028|-|$3,311|$3,311|\\n|Thereafter|-|$58,285|$58,285|\\n|Total|$1,563,851|$120,483|$1,684,334|\\n\\nLitigation and Contingencies\\n\\nThe Company is subject to legal proceedings arising in the normal course of its operations. The Company does not anticipate that the disposition of any currently pending proceeding will have a material effect on the Company’s operations, business or financial condition.\\n\\nGeneral Guarantees and Indemnifications\\n\\nIn the normal course of business, the Company enters into numerous aircraft financing and real estate leasing arrangements that have various guarantees included in such contracts. It is common in such lease transactions for the lessee to agree to indemnify the lessor and other related third parties for tort liabilities that arise out of, or relate to, the lessee’s use of the leased aircraft or occupancy of the leased premises. In some cases, this indemnity extends to related liabilities arising from the negligence of the indemnified parties, but usually excludes any liabilities caused by such parties' gross negligence or willful misconduct. Additionally, the lessee typically indemnifies such parties for any environmental liability that arises out of or relates to the lessee's use of the real estate leased premises. The Company believes that it is insured (subject to deductibles) for most of the tort liabilities and related indemnities\\n---\\ndescribed above with respect to the aircraft and real estate that it leases. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the potential amount of future payments, if any, under the foregoing indemnities and agreements.\\n\\nCredit Card Holdbacks\\n\\nUnder the Company’s bank-issued credit card processing agreements, proceeds from advance ticket sales may be held back to serve as collateral to cover any possible chargebacks or other disputed charges that may occur. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no holdbacks held with the Company's credit card processors.\\n\\nIn the event of a material adverse change in the Company's business, the credit card processor could increase holdbacks to up to 100% of the amount of outstanding credit card tickets that are unflown (e.g., air traffic liability, excluding frequent flyer deferred revenue), which would result in a restriction of cash. If the Company were unable to obtain a waiver of, or otherwise mitigate the increase in the restriction of cash, it could have a material impact on the Company's operations, business or financial condition.\\n\\n|Assets Held-For-Sale Activity for the three months ended March 31, 2024|\\n|---|\\n| |ATR Aircraft|Commercial Real Estate|Total|\\n|Beginning balance as of December 31, 2023|$1,135 (in thousands)|—|$1,135|\\n|Additions|—|—|—|\\n|Proceeds from sale|(105)|—|(105)|\\n|Realized gains|61|—|61|\\n|Realized losses|—|—|—|\\n|Ending balance as of March 31, 2024|$1,091|—|$1,091|\\n---\\n# Assets Held-For-Sale Activity for the three months ended March 31, 2023\\n\\n| |Commercial Real Estate|ATR Aircraft|Total|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Beginning balance as of December 31, 2022|$6,291|$7,728|$14,019|\\n|Additions|—|—|—|\\n|Proceeds from sale|($16,470)|($2,769)|($19,239)|\\n|Realized gains|$10,179|$65|$10,244|\\n|Realized losses|—|—|—|\\n|Ending balance as of March 31, 2023|$—|$5,024|$5,024|\\n\\nIn February 2023, the Company entered into a sale agreement for the sale of its commercial real estate and recognized a gain on sale of $10.2 million, which was recorded in Other operating expense in the consolidated statements of operations.

The Company anticipates completing the sale of remaining aircraft parts classified as held-for-sale in 2024, and will continue to monitor the asset group for potential impairment.\\n\\n# Condensed

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\\n\\nForward-Looking Statements\\n\\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that reflect our current views with respect to certain current and future events and financial performance. Such forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements related to the Merger (defined below), including statements related to the timing of completion of the Merger, or the receipt of necessary approvals to complete the Merger; the significance and timing of costs related to the Merger; the impact on us of litigation or other stockholder action related to the Merger; the effects on us and our stockholders if the Merger is not completed; our financial statements and results of operations; any expectations of operating expenses, deferred revenue, interest rates, tax rates, income taxes, deferred tax assets, valuation allowances or other financial items; the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and related impacts will materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial performance, results of operations, financial position or achievement of strategic objectives; the demand for air travel in the markets in which we operate; demand for air travel to Maui, Hawai'i; changes in our future capital needs; estimations related to our liquidity requirements; future obligations and related impact of such obligations and our expectations related to our agreement with Amazon; the number of aircraft that we will be operating under the ATSA by the end of 2024; the availability of aircraft fuel, aircraft parts and personnel; the impact and timing of A321neo engine shortages on our operating performance (including bookings, revenue and results of operations), available seat miles, operating revenue, and operating cost per available seat mile for the second quarter of 2024, 2024 and potentially beyond; expectations about the recovery of international travel demand; expectations related to currency fluctuations; expected salary and related costs; our expected fleet as of March 31, 2025; estimates of annual fuel expenses and measure of the effects of fuel prices on our business; the impact of inflation on our business, our investments and the broader economy; the impact of climate change or natural disasters; the availability of, and efforts seeking, future financing; changes in our fleet plan and related cash outlays; committed capital expenditures; expected cash payments related to our post-retirement plan obligations; estimated financial charges; expected purchases of aircraft; expected delivery or deferment of new aircraft and engines; the impact of accounting standards on our financial statements; the effects of any litigation on our operations or business; the effects of our fuel and currency risk hedging policies; the fair value and expected maturity of our debt obligations; our estimated contractual obligations; and other matters that do not relate strictly to historical facts or statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “projects,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “estimates,” “could,” “would,” “will,” “might,” “may,” variations of such words, and similar expressions are also intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are and will be, as the case may be, subject to many risks, uncertainties and assumptions relating to our operations and business environment, all of which may cause our actual results to be materially different from any future results, expressed or implied, in these forward-looking statements.\\n\\nFactors that could affect such forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to: the impact of our agreement with Amazon and the role of cargo in our business model; fluctuations and the extent of declining demand for air transportation in the markets in which we operate; our dependence on the tourism industry; our ability to generate sufficient cash and manage the cash available to us; our ability to accurately forecast quarterly and annual results; global economic volatility; macroeconomic political and regulatory developments; geopolitical\\n---\\n# Our Business\\n\\nWe are engaged in the scheduled air transportation of passengers and cargo amongst the Hawaiian Islands (the Neighbor Island routes), between the Hawaiian Islands and certain cities in the U.S. mainland (the North America routes and collectively with the Neighbor Island routes, referred to as our Domestic routes), and between the Hawaiian Islands and the South Pacific, Australia, New Zealand and Asia (the International routes), collectively referred to as our “Scheduled Operations.” We offer non-stop service to Hawai'i from 15 U.S. mainland cities, which is more U.S. gateway cities than any other airline, and also provide approximately 144 daily flights between the Hawaiian Islands. In addition, we operate various charter flights. We are the longest serving airline, as well as the largest airline headquartered in the state of Hawai'i and the tenth largest domestic airline in the United States based on revenue passenger miles (RPMs) as reported by the Research and Innovative Technology Administration Bureau of Transportation Statistics as of January 2024, the latest available data. As of March 31, 2024, we had 7,386 active employees.\\n\\nOn October 20, 2022, we entered into an Air Transportation Services Agreement (ATSA) with Amazon.com Services LLC (Customer), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Amazon.com Inc. (Amazon), to provide certain air cargo transportation services to the Customer for an initial term of eight years. Thereafter, the Customer may elect to extend the ATSA for two years and, at the end of such period, the parties may mutually agree to extend the term for three additional years. The ATSA provides for us to initially operate ten A330-300F aircraft for the air cargo transportation services with the Customer having the right to enter into work orders for additional aircraft. We will supply flight crews, perform maintenance and certain administrative functions, and procure aircraft insurance. The Customer will pay us a fixed monthly fee per aircraft, a per flight hour fee, and a per flight cycle fee for each flight cycle operated. The Customer will also reimburse us for certain operating expenses, including fuel, certain maintenance, and insurance premiums. Operations under the ATSA commenced on October 2, 2023 and as of March 31, 2024, we were operating one aircraft with two additional aircraft scheduled to commence operation in the second quarter of 2024. We anticipate that we will be operating six aircraft under the ATSA by the end of 2024.\\n---\\nGeneral information about us is available at https://www.hawaiianairlines.com.

Analysis under GAAP required us to increase the valuation allowance related to the NOLs which resulted in a lower effective tax rate for the period|\\n\\nSee “Results of Operations” below for further discussion of changes in revenue and operating expense.\\n\\nMerger with Alaska Air Group\\n\\nOn December 2, 2023, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) with Alaska Air Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (Alaska), and Marlin Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Alaska (Merger Sub), pursuant to which, subject to satisfaction or waiver of conditions therein, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the Merger), with the Company surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Alaska.\\n\\nAt the effective time of the Merger (the Effective Time), each share of our common stock, Series B Special Preferred Stock, Series C Special Preferred Stock, and Series D Special Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to certain customary exceptions specified in the Merger Agreement, will be converted into the right to receive $18.00 per share, payable to the holder in cash, without interest.\\n\\nCompletion of the Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by the Company's stockholders, which was obtained on February 16, 2024; performance by the parties in all material respects of their obligations under the Merger Agreement; the receipt of required regulatory approvals; and the absence of an order or law preventing, materially restraining, or materially impairing the consummation of the Merger.\\n\\nOn February 7, 2024, the Company and Alaska each received a request for additional information and documentary material (together, the Second Request) from the Department of Justice (DOJ) in connection with the DOJ’s review\\n---\\n# of the Merger\\n\\nOn March 27, 2024, Hawaiian and Alaska entered into a timing agreement with the DOJ pursuant to which we agreed, among other things, not to consummate the Merger before 90 days following the date on which both parties have certified substantial compliance with the Second Request unless we have received written notice from the DOJ prior to the end of such 90-day period that the DOJ has closed its investigation of the Merger.\\n\\nThe Merger Agreement includes customary termination rights in favor of each party. In certain circumstances, we may be required to pay Alaska a termination fee of $39.6 million in connection with the termination of the Merger Agreement.\\n\\nThe Merger is expected to close within 12 to 18 months of the date of the Merger Agreement.\\n\\n# Material Changes to our Consolidated Balance Sheet\\n\\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2024, material changes to our Consolidated Balance Sheet consisted of the following:\\n\\n- As of March 31, 2024, our total debt was $1.7 billion, an increase of $106.4 million, or 6.7%, as compared to $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2023. The increase is attributed to $131.4 million in financing obtained for our first Boeing 787-9 aircraft delivery in the first quarter of 2024, partially offset by scheduled debt repayments.\\n- As of March 31, 2024, our air traffic liability and current frequent flyer deferred revenue was $757.9 million, an increase of $124.5 million, or 19.7%, as compared to $633.3 million as of December 31, 2023. The increase in air traffic liability is primarily due to an increase in advanced ticket sales and the seasonality of passenger travel.\\n\\nRefer to the Cash Flow and Use of Liquidity section below for additional discussion.\\n\\n# Fleet Summary\\n\\n|Aircraft Type|Leased (1)|Owned (2)|Total|Leased (1)|Owned (2)|Total|Leased (1)|Owned (2)|Total|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|A330-200|12|12|24|12|12|24|11|12|23|\\n|A330-300F (3)|-|-|-|2|-|2|7|-|7|\\n|A321neo|4|14|18|4|14|18|4|14|18|\\n|787-9 (4)|-|-|-|-|1|1|-|4|4|\\n|717-200 (5)|5|14|19|1|18|19|-|19|19|\\n|ATR 42-500 (6)|-|1|1|-|-|-|-|-|-|\\n|ATR 72-200 (6)|-|1|1|-|-|-|-|-|-|\\n|Total|21|42|63|19|45|64|22|49|71|\\n\\n(1) Leased aircraft include aircraft under both finance and operating leases.\\n\\n(2) Includes unencumbered aircraft as well as those purchased and under various debt financing arrangements.\\n---\\n# Aircraft Utilization\\n\\n(3)\\nA330-300F aircraft to be utilized under the ATSA with Amazon. Operations under the ATSA commenced on October 2, 2023. As discussed above, the ATSA provides for the operation of 10 aircraft with customer options to expand the fleet.\\n\\n# Aircraft Deliveries\\n\\n(4)\\nIn February 2024, we took delivery of our first Boeing 787-9 aircraft under a financing lease, which did not meet the criteria for a sale under the applicable accounting framework and is therefore recognized as a debt financing, and will be placed into revenue service in April 2024. We took delivery of our second aircraft in April 2024 under a financing arrangement, which we anticipate placing into service in May 2024, with a third aircraft scheduled for delivery in late 2024.\\n\\n# Aircraft Purchases\\n\\n(5)\\nIn December 2023, we entered into an agreement to purchase one 717-200 aircraft that was under a lease agreement. During the first quarter of 2024, we entered into an agreement to purchase three additional 717-200 aircraft previously under lease. We expect to purchase the remaining 717-200 aircraft under lease in the second quarter of 2024.\\n\\n# Asset Sales\\n\\n(6)\\nThe ATR 42-500 turboprop and ATR 72-200 turboprop aircraft are owned by Airline Contract Maintenance & Equipment, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary. In 2021, we announced the termination of our 'Ohana by Hawaiian operations, which operated under a capacity purchase agreement with a third-party provider. As of March 31, 2024, there was one remaining aircraft and certain aircraft parts. The asset group was classified as Assets held-for-sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In October 2023, we completed the sale of the remaining ATR 72-200 aircraft, which did not result in a gain or loss on the transaction. We anticipate completing the sale of remaining aircraft parts in the second quarter of 2024.\\n\\n# Results of Operations\\n\\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024, we generated a net loss of $137.6 million, or $2.65 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $98.3 million, or $1.91 per diluted share, for the same period in 2023.\\n\\n# Selected Consolidated Statistical Data (unaudited)\\n\\n| |Three months ended March 31, 2024|2023|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Scheduled Operations:| | |\\n|Revenue passengers flown|2,620|2,592|\\n|Revenue passenger miles (RPM)|4,072,473|3,844,061|\\n|Available seat miles (ASM)|5,049,598|4,914,619|\\n|Passenger revenue per RPM (Yield)|14.33 ¢|14.27 ¢|\\n|Passenger load factor (RPM/ASM)|80.6 %|78.2 %|\\n|Passenger revenue per ASM (PRASM)|11.55 ¢|11.16 ¢|\\n|Total Operations:| | |\\n|Revenue passengers flown|2,621|2,593|\\n|RPM|4,073,159|3,845,978|\\n---\\n# ASM\\n\\n5,050,841\\n4,917,517\\n\\n# Operating revenue per ASM (RASM)\\n\\n12.78 ¢\\n12.46 ¢\\n\\n# Operating cost per ASM (CASM)\\n\\n15.72 ¢\\n14.85 ¢\\n\\n# CASM excluding aircraft fuel and non-recurring items (a)\\n\\n11.82 ¢\\n11.04 ¢\\n\\n# Aircraft fuel expense per ASM (b)\\n\\n3.74 ¢\\n4.02 ¢\\n\\n# Revenue block hours operated\\n\\n52,141\\n52,228\\n\\n# Gallons of aircraft fuel consumed (c)\\n\\n67,651\\n64,853\\n\\n# Average cost per gallon of aircraft fuel (b)\\n\\n$2.79\\n$3.05\\n\\n(a) Represents adjusted unit costs, a non-GAAP measure.

Details of this change are described in the table below:\\n\\n| |Three months ended March 31, 2024|Passenger Revenue|Yield|RPMs|ASMs|PRASM|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|(in thousands)| | | | | | |\\n|Domestic|$451,598|2.1%|4.1%|(2.0)%|(4.5)%|6.9%|\\n|International|$131,850|24.3|(11.0)|39.8|27.9|(2.8)|\\n|Total|$583,448|6.4%|0.4%|5.9%|2.7%|3.5%|\\n\\nDomestic passenger revenue increased $9.2 million, or 2.1%, during the three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023, on a capacity reduction, as measured in ASM, of 4.5%. Demand on our domestic network has been supported by improved yields; however, these improvements have been, and continue to be, negatively impacted by engine shortages from Pratt & Whitney and its affiliates, which announced in July 2023 that a significant portion of the PW110G-JM engine fleet, including several engines utilized by Hawaiian, would require accelerated removals and inspections. This unanticipated time out of service resulted in lower-than-expected capacity growth in the quarter and we may continue to experience operational disruptions from our engine shortages from Pratt & Whitney during the remainder of 2024 and potentially beyond.\\n\\nOur Neighbor Island traffic, which accounted for approximately 22.2% of total Domestic passenger revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2024, increased by 17.8% as compared to the same period in 2023.\\n---\\nover-year improvement in the Neighbor Island market, revenue during the first quarter was down 25.1% as compared to the same period in 2019 as we continue to face increased competitive pressures with additional capacity in the market combined with the lower priced Neighbor Island route fares.\\n\\nInternational route passenger revenue increased by $25.8 million, or 24.3%, during the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily driven by increased capacity, which was up 27.9%. Despite improvements, our International route network remains depressed in comparison to pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels, with revenue down 15.4% during the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2019. We expect demand on our International routes to continue to lag behind demand on our Domestic routes as we expect the weakening of the Japanese Yen, which has increased the cost of travel for customers from Japan, to continue to negatively impact international demand until the Japanese Yen recovers.\\n\\nWe expect our ASMs for the second quarter of 2024 to be up approximately 3.5% to 6.5% compared to the same period in 2023. We expect RASM will range between down 1.5% and up 1.5% for the second quarter of 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023.\\n\\nOther Operating Revenue\\n\\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2024, Other operating revenue decreased by $2.0 million, or 3.1%, as compared to the same period in 2023, primarily driven by a reduction in cargo revenue of $1.4 million due to lower cargo volumes during the period. Other components in Other operating revenue include, but are not limited to, commissions, and fees earned under certain marketing agreements, which collectively decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2024 by approximately $0.6 million, as compared to the same period in 2023.\\n\\n|Operating expenses|Increase / (decrease) for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2023|$|%|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Wages and benefits|$20,002|8.3%| |\\n|Aircraft fuel, including taxes and delivery|($8,847)|(4.5%)| |\\n|Maintenance, materials and repairs|$20,684|41.1%| |\\n|Aircraft and passenger servicing|$2,892|6.8%| |\\n|Commissions and other selling|$205|0.7%| |\\n|Aircraft rent|$1,535|5.4%| |\\n|Other rentals and landing fees|$4,407|11.4%| |\\n|Depreciation and amortization|$300|0.9%| |\\n|Purchased services|$3,403|9.7%| |\\n---\\n# Special items\\n\\n| |Amount|Percentage|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Other|11,120|32.0|\\n|Total|$64,183|8.8%|\\n\\n# Wages and benefits\\n\\nWages and benefits expense increased $20.0 million, or 8.3%, during the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year period. The increase in wages and benefits expense is primarily attributed to increased headcount and training costs as we prepared for the ramp up of our ATSA operations with Amazon, as well as the introduction of our first Boeing 787 aircraft, which was placed into service in April 2024, scheduled contractual wage increases and increased inflationary and hiring costs. In February 2023, the pilots ratified a new four year collective bargaining agreement (CBA), which included, amongst other things, a signing bonus, pay scale increases across all fleet types, improved health benefits and cost sharing, and enhancements to the Company's postretirement and disability plans.\\n\\nWe expect that wages and benefits will increase during the second quarter of 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023, as a result of scheduled contractual wage increases, hiring and training costs associated with the commencement of operations under the ATSA in October 2023 and our Boeing 787 operations beginning in April 2024, and continued inflationary pressures.\\n\\n# Aircraft fuel\\n\\nAircraft fuel expense decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year period, primarily due to a decrease in the average fuel cost per gallon, offset by increased consumption.\\n\\n| |2024|2023|% Change|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Aircraft fuel expense, including taxes and delivery|$188,778|$197,625|(4.5)%|\\n|Fuel gallons consumed|67,651|64,853|4.3 %|\\n|Average fuel price per gallon, including taxes and delivery|$2.79|$3.05|(8.5)%|\\n\\nFuel consumption increased by 4.3% during the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the prior year period. The fuel consumption increase was a result of increased operations and aircraft up-gauging as a result of supply chain and engine availability issues impacting certain of our A321neo aircraft.\\n\\nWe believe economic fuel expense is a good measure of the effect of fuel prices on our business as it most closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with the purchase of fuel for our operations in a period and is consistent with how our management manages our business and assesses our operating performance. We define economic fuel expense as GAAP fuel expense, including taxes and delivery, plus (gains)/losses on settlement of fuel derivatives contracts in the period, inclusive of costs related to hedging premiums.\\n\\nEconomic fuel expense is calculated as follows:\\n---\\n# Three months ended March 31, 2024 2023 % Change\\n\\n| |2024|2023|% Change|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Aircraft fuel expense, including taxes and delivery|$188,778|$197,625|(4.5)%|\\n|Realized losses on settlement of fuel derivative contracts|$2,398|$1,513|58.5 %|\\n|Economic fuel expense|$191,176|$199,138|(4.0)%|\\n|Fuel gallons consumed|67,651|64,853|4.3 %|\\n|Economic fuel price per gallon|$2.83|$3.07|(7.8)%|\\n\\nWe expect that fuel gallons consumed will be up between 2.5% to 5.0% during the second quarter of 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023.\\n\\nMaintenance, materials and repairs\\n\\nMaintenance, materials and repairs expense increased $20.7 million, or 41.1%, during the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. In December 2022, we entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with one of our third-party service providers to terminate our Amended and Restated Complete Fleet Services (CFS) Agreement (Amended CFS) covering A330-200 aircraft. The Amended CFS was originally scheduled to run through December 2027, and terminated in April 2023. Upon execution of the MOU, we agreed to pay a total of $12.5 million in termination fees, which was recognized in fiscal year 2022. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $24.1 million in deferred liabilities which was amortized into earnings as contra-maintenance materials and repairs expense during the remainder of the contract period. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we recognized approximately $18.1 million in amortization. Excluding this reduction in 2023, maintenance, materials and repairs expense increased $2.6 million, or 3.8%, during the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023.\\n\\nWe expect maintenance, materials and repairs expense to increase during the second quarter of 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023 as a result of scheduled heavy maintenance events expected in the period and increased PBH costs.\\n\\nAircraft and passenger servicing\\n\\nAircraft and passenger servicing expense increased by $2.9 million, or 6.8%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher volume-related expenses associated with increased passenger demand and inflationary pressures. We expect aircraft and passenger service expense to increase during the second quarter of 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023.\\n\\nOther rentals and landing fees\\n\\nOther rentals and landing fees increased by $4.4 million, or 11.4%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. A portion of our other rentals and landing fees are variable in nature and are dependent on factors such as the number of departures and passengers. The increase in landing fees and other rentals is attributed to an increase in rates and operations as discussed above. We expect other rentals and landing fees expense to increase during the second quarter of 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023 due primarily to increased airport costs.\\n---\\n# Purchased services\\n\\nPurchased services increased by $3.4 million, or 9.7%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase in purchased services is primarily related to our increased operations during the three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023. We expect other purchased services expense to increase during the second quarter of 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023.\\n\\n# Special Items\\n\\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2024, we recorded $8.5 million in Special items as a result of expenses related to our merger with Alaska, primarily consisting of legal, advisory, and other fees. Refer to the Merger with Alaska Air Group subsection above for additional information on the Merger.\\n\\n# Other expense\\n\\nOther expense increased $11.1 million, or 32.0%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily related to personnel-related expenditures for crew travel, professional and technical expenditures, and other miscellaneous expense. During the first quarter of 2023, we also recognized a $10.2 million gain on the sale of commercial real estate.\\n\\n# Nonoperating Income (Expense)\\n\\nNet nonoperating expense decreased by $4.2 million, or 50.0%, during the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023. The change was attributed to favorable movements in unrealized gains (losses) associated with our foreign denominated debt and fuel derivatives portfolio, offset by decreased generation of interest income commensurate with the reduction of our investment portfolio.\\n\\n# Income Taxes\\n\\nOur effective tax rate was approximately 10.0% for the three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to 21.9% during the same period in 2023. The effective tax rate represents a blend of federal and state taxes, the impact of certain nondeductible items, and the valuation allowance on certain federal and state net operating loss carryforwards, realized capital losses, and unrealized capital losses on equity securities during the periods.\\n\\nAs of March 31, 2024, we generated federal and state NOLs of approximately $451.4 million and $968.8 million, respectively, which are available to reduce future taxable income. Our ability to use NOL carryforwards depend on the amount of taxable income generated in future periods. During the first quarter of 2024, we increased our valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets. The incremental valuation allowance recorded by the Company during the first quarter of 2024 was primarily due to uncertainties in the future utilization of deferred tax assets related to our NOL carryforwards for federal income tax purposes. As a result of the incremental increase in the valuation allowance, our annual effective tax rate decreased to approximately 10.0%.\\n\\n# Liquidity and Capital Resources\\n\\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments (excluding restricted cash) totaled approximately $897.3 million as of March 31, 2024, compared to approximately $908.5 million as of December 31, 2023.\\n\\nAs of March 31, 2024, our current assets exceeded our current liabilities by approximately $141.3 million as compared to $25.5 million as of December 31, 2023. Approximately $757.9 million of our current liabilities relate to our advanced ticket sales and frequent flyer deferred revenue.\\n---\\n# Cash Flow and Uses of Liquidity\\n\\n# Operating Activities\\n\\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $0.3 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $118.3 million during the prior year period. Our operating cash flows are impacted by the following factors:\\n\\nAdvanced Ticket Sales. We sell tickets for air travel and record the receipt on advance sales as deferred revenue in air traffic liability. The air traffic liability typically increases during the winter and spring months as advanced ticket sales grow prior to the summer and fall peak travel seasons and decreases upon utilization during these seasons. As discussed above, we noted marked improvements in air travel demand during the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023; however, overall demand (measured in passengers flown) remains below 2019 levels, down approximately 7.1%, largely due to international travel demand lagging the recovery of domestic travel.\\n\\nAircraft Fuel. Fuel expense represented approximately 23.8% of our total operating expense during the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to 27.1% during the same period in 2023. The market price for jet fuel is volatile, which can impact the comparability of our cash flows from operations. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, the average fuel price per gallon decreased 8.5%, as compared to the same period in 2023.\\n\\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plan Funding. During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, we were not required to, and did not, make contributions to our defined benefit and other postretirement plans. Future funding requirements for our defined benefit and other postretirement plans are dependent upon many factors such as interest rates, funded status, applicable regulatory requirements and the level and timing of asset returns. Given available funding credits in the defined benefit plan from past contributions in excess of required minimums, we continue to evaluate whether any cash contributions will be made to our defined benefit plan during 2024.\\n\\nOperating Lease Obligations. As of March 31, 2024, we had $363.1 million of operating lease obligations, which range between approximately $29.7 million to $84.6 million on an annual basis between 2024 and 2027. We have approximately $75.8 million in operating lease obligations during the remainder of 2023.\\n\\nOther Commitments. We have certain purchase obligations under which we are required to make minimum payments for goods and services, including, but not limited to aircraft maintenance, IT, capacity purchases, and reservations. Total contractual obligations do not include long-term contracts where the commitment is variable in nature (with no minimum guarantee), such as aircraft maintenance deposits due under operating leases and fees under certain other agreements such as aircraft maintenance PBH, computer reservation systems and credit card processing agreements, or when the agreements contain short-term cancellation provisions. As of March 31, 2024, we had approximately $120.5 million of such obligations, which range from approximately $3.3 million to $18.3 million on an annual basis over the next five years.\\n\\n# Investing Activities\\n\\nNet cash used in investing activities was $33.3 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $49.4 million during the prior year period. Investing activities include capital expenditures, primarily related to aircraft and other equipment, and the purchases and sales of short-term investments.\\n\\nShort-term Investments. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, our purchases and proceeds from the sale and maturity of short-term investments resulted in net cash inflow of $93.7 million as compared to net cash inflow of $47.3 million during the same period in 2023.\\n---\\n# Capital Expenditures\\n\\nOur capital expenditures are primarily related to the purchase of aircraft, fleet modifications, and technology enhancements. Our capital expenditures were $127.0 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 as compared to $106.2 million in capital expenditures during the same period in 2023, primarily related to the delivery of our first Boeing 787-9 aircraft and scheduled predelivery payments for scheduled future deliveries.\\n\\n# Capital Commitments\\n\\nAs of March 31, 2024, we had the following capital commitments consisting of firm aircraft and engine orders and purchase rights:\\n\\n|Aircraft Type|Firm Orders|Purchase Rights|Expected Delivery Dates|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|A321neo aircraft|-|9|N/A|\\n|Boeing 787-9 aircraft|11|8|Between 2024 and 2027|\\n|General Electric GEnx spare engines:| | | |\\n|Boeing 787-9 spare engines|3|1|Between 2024 and 2027|\\n\\nCommitted expenditures for these aircraft, engines, and related flight equipment are approximately $225.9 million for the remainder of 2024, $419.6 million in 2025, $665.5 million in 2026, and $252.9 million in 2027.\\n\\nIn October 2020, we entered into an amendment to our Boeing 787-9 purchase agreement, which changed the scheduled delivery of each aircraft and related engines to between 2022 and 2026. In December 2022, we entered into a supplemental agreement to the purchase agreement, pursuant to which (a) we agreed with Boeing to defer delivery of the Boeing 787-9 aircraft, and (b) agreed to exercise purchase options for an additional two Boeing 787-9 aircraft. In February 2024, we took delivery of our first Boeing 787-9 aircraft. This aircraft was placed into service in April 2024. We took delivery of our second aircraft in April 2024 with a third aircraft scheduled for delivery in late 2024. Refer to Note 12 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion.\\n\\n# Financing Activities\\n\\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $110.6 million during the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to net cash used in financing activities of $26.0 million during the prior year period. Our financing cash flows are impacted by the following factors:\\n\\nDebt and Finance Lease Obligations. During the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, we repaid $18.8 million and $25.0 million of long-term debt and finance lease obligations, respectively. In February 2024, we took delivery of our first Boeing 787-9 aircraft, which was financed. The transaction did not qualify as a sale under the applicable accounting framework and we recorded $131.4 million as debt in the Consolidated balance sheet.\\n\\nAs of March 31, 2024, scheduled maturities of our debt remaining in 2024 were $33.5 million. The scheduled maturities total $64.4 million in 2025, $1.3 billion in 2026, $21.7 million in 2027, $22.7 million in 2028, and beyond 2028, scheduled maturities aggregate to $178.6 million. In addition, we are obligated to make periodic interest payments at fixed and variable rates, depending on the terms of the applicable debt agreements. Based on applicable interest rates and scheduled debt maturities as of March 31, 2024, these interest obligations total $65.3 million.\\n---\\nmillion remaining in 2024, $88.4 million in 2025, $32.7 million in 2026, $11.8 million in 2027, $10.7 million in 2028, and $26.7 million thereafter.\\n\\nAs of March 31, 2024, we had $75.9 million of finance lease obligations. We have approximately $8.5 million in finance lease obligations during the remainder of 2024, approximately $11.3 million for each year between 2025 and 2028, and approximately $22.3 million in the aggregate thereafter.\\n\\nUndrawn Lines of Credit. As of March 31, 2024, our revolving line of credit, which matures in December 2025, remained undrawn and available under our $235.0 million revolving credit facility.\\n\\nCredit Card Holdbacks. Under our bank-issued credit card processing agreements, proceeds from advance ticket sales may be held back to serve as collateral to cover any possible chargebacks or other disputed charges that may occur. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no holdbacks held by our credit card processors. In the event of a material adverse change in our business, the credit card processors could increase holdbacks to an amount up to 100% of the outstanding credit card tickets that are unflown (e.g., air traffic liability, excluding frequent flyer deferred revenue), which would result in the restriction of cash. If we were unable to obtain a waiver of, or otherwise mitigate the increase in the restriction of cash, it could have a material impact on our operations, business or financial condition.\\n\\nCovenants. We were in compliance with covenants contained in our financing agreements as of March 31, 2024.\\n\\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\\n\\nWe believe the disclosure of non-GAAP financial measures is useful information to readers of our financial statements because:\\n\\n- We believe it is the basis by which we are evaluated by many industry analysts and investors;\\n- These measures are often used in management and Board of Directors decision making analysis;\\n- It improves a reader’s ability to compare our results to those of other airlines; and\\n- It is consistent with how we present information in our quarterly financial results press releases.\\n\\nSee tables below for reconciliation between GAAP consolidated net income (loss) to adjusted consolidated net income (loss), including per share amounts (in thousands unless otherwise indicated), adjusted Operating Costs per Available Seat Mile (CASM), and adjusted EBITDA. The adjustments are described below:\\n\\n- CBA related expense. In February 2023, pilots represented by the Air Line Pilots Association ratified a new four-year CBA, which included, amongst other things, a signing bonus, pay scale increases across all fleet types, improved health benefits and cost sharing, and enhancements to the Company's postretirement and disability plans. In connection with the ratification, we recorded a signing bonus and vacation liability true-up of approximately $17.7 million in wages and benefits during the first quarter of 2023.\\n- Contract termination amortization. In December 2022, we entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with one of our third-party service providers to early terminate our Amended and Restated Complete Fleet Services Agreement (Amended CFS) covering A330-200 aircraft. The Amended CFS was originally scheduled to run through December 2027, but was terminated in April 2023. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, we recognized approximately $18.1 million in amortization within Maintenance, materials and repairs in the Consolidated Statements of Operation.\\n---\\nSpecial items. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we recorded $8.5 million in Special items as a result of expenses related to our merger with Alaska, primarily consisting of legal, advisory, and other fees.\\n\\nGain on sale of commercial real estate. In February 2023, we entered into an agreement for the sale of our commercial real estate and recognized a gain on the transaction of $10.2 million, which was recorded in Other operating expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\\n\\nInterest income on federal tax refund. In March 2023, we received $4.7 million in interest in connection with a $66.8 million federal tax refund received related to fiscal year 2018. The interest was recorded in Interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\\n\\nChanges in fair value of fuel derivative contracts. Changes in fair value of derivative contracts, net of tax, are based on market prices for open contracts as of the end of the reporting period. This line item includes the unrealized amounts of fuel derivatives (not designated as hedges) that will settle in future periods and the reversal of prior period unrealized amounts.\\n\\nUnrealized gain on foreign debt. Unrealized gain on foreign debt is based on the fluctuation in exchange rates and the measurement of foreign-denominated debt to our functional currency.\\n\\nUnrealized gain on equity securities. Unrealized gain on equity securities is driven by changes in market prices and currency fluctuations, which is recorded in Other nonoperating expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\\n\\nWe believe that adjusting for the impact of the changes in fair value of equity securities and fuel derivative contracts, fluctuations in exchange rates on debt instruments denominated in foreign currency, and non-recurring expenses and income/gains (including CBA-related expense, contract termination amortization, Special items, interest income on federal tax refunds, and gain on sale of commercial real estate), helps investors better analyze our operational performance and compare our results to other airlines in the periods presented.\\n\\n| |Three months ended March 31, 2024|Three months ended March 31, 2023|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Total Net Loss, as reported|$(137,565)|$(98,257)|\\n|Diluted Net Loss Per Share|$(2.65)|$(1.91)|\\n|Adjusted for:| | |\\n|CBA related expense|-|$17,727|\\n|Contract termination amortization|-|$(18,114)|\\n|Special items|$8,482|-|\\n|Gain on sale of commercial real estate|-|$(10,179)|\\n|Interest income on federal tax refund|-|$(4,672)|\\n|Changes in fair value of fuel derivative contracts|$(1,816)|$3,552|\\n---\\n| |2024|2023|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|GAAP Operating Expenses|$794,213|$730,030|\\n|CBA related expense| |($17,727)|\\n|Special items|($8,482)| |\\n|Contract termination amortization| |$18,114|\\n|Gain on sale of commercial real estate| |$10,179|\\n|Operating expenses excluding non-recurring items|$785,731|$740,596|\\n|Aircraft fuel, including taxes and delivery|($188,778)|($197,625)|\\n|Operating expenses excluding aircraft fuel and non-recurring items|$596,953|$542,971|\\n\\n| |2024|2023|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|CASM - GAAP|15.72 ¢|14.85 ¢|\\n|CBA related expense| |(0.36)|\\n|Special items|(0.16)| |\\n|Contract termination amortization| |0.37|\\n|Gain on sale of commercial real estate| |0.20|\\n|Aircraft fuel, including taxes and delivery|(3.74)|(4.02)|\\n|CASM excluding aircraft fuel and non-recurring items|11.82 ¢|11.04 ¢|\\n---\\nWe believe that adjusting earnings for interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, non-recurring operating expenses (such as changes in unrealized gains and losses on financial instruments) and one-time charges helps investors better analyze our financial performance by allowing for company-to-company and period-over-period comparisons that are unaffected by company-specific or one-time occurrences.\\n\\nWe reclassified prior period EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to conform to the current period presentation.\\n\\n| |Three months ended March 31,| | |\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n| |2024|2023|(in thousands)|\\n|Net Loss|$ (137,565)|$ (98,257)| |\\n|Income tax benefit|(15,285)|(27,574)| |\\n|Depreciation and amortization|32,967|32,667| |\\n|Interest expense and amortization of debt discounts and issuance costs|24,069|22,880| |\\n|Interest income|(10,021)|(16,465)| |\\n|Capitalized interest|(3,134)|(1,458)| |\\n|EBITDA, as reported|(108,969)|(88,207)| |\\n|Adjusted for:| | | |\\n|CBA related expense|-|17,727| |\\n|Contract termination amortization|-|(18,114)| |\\n|Gain on sale of commercial real estate|-|(10,179)| |\\n|Interest income on tax refund|-|(4,672)| |\\n|Changes in fair value of fuel derivative instruments|(1,816)|3,552| |\\n|Unrealized gain on foreign debt|(8,555)|(2,488)| |\\n|Special items|8,482|-| |\\n|Unrealized gain on equity securities|(5,115)|(944)| |\\n|Adjusted EBITDA|$ (115,973)|$ (103,325)| |\\n\\nCritical Accounting Policies\\n\\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and/or conditions.\\n---\\n# ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\\n\\nThere have been no material changes in market risk from the information provided in Part II, Item 7A \\\"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\\\", in our 2023 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\n\\n# ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\\n\\n# Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\\n\\nOur management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act)), which have been designed to permit us to effectively identify and timely disclose important information. Based on that evaluation, our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\\n\\n# Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\n\\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\\n\\n# Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\\n\\nA control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, will be detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.\\n---\\n# PART II. OTHER INFORMATION\\n\\n# ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.\\n\\nWe are not a party to any litigation that is expected to have a significant effect on our operations or business.\\n\\n# ITEM 1A.

control\\nAmazon may become a significant stockholder\\nThe publication of research about us by analysts\\n\\n# Securities Offerings Risks\\n\\nThe effect of our indebtedness and liabilities related to our debt offerings on pe cash flow available for our operations and to satisfy our obligations related such debt\\n\\n# ALASKA AIR GROUP MERGER\\n---\\nThe pendency of the Merger may cause disruption in our business.\\n\\nThe Merger Agreement restricts us from taking specified actions without Alaska's consent until the Merger is completed or the Merger Agreement is terminated. These restrictions are more fully described in the Merger Agreement. These restrictions may affect our ability to execute our business strategies and attain our financial and other goals and may impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\\n\\nThe pendency of the Merger could cause disruptions to our business or business relationships, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Parties with which we have business relationships, including guests, employees and labor groups, suppliers, third-party service providers, and third-party distribution channels, may be uncertain as to the future of such relationships and may delay or defer certain business decisions, seek alternative relationships with third parties or seek to alter their present business relationships with us. Parties with whom we otherwise may have sought to establish business relationships may seek alternative relationships with third parties.\\n\\nThe pursuit of the Merger is expected to place a significant burden on our management and internal resources. The diversion of management’s attention away from day-to-day business concerns and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\\n\\nIn addition, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs, expenses, and fees in connection with the Merger. The substantial majority of these costs will be non-recurring expenses relating to the Merger, and many of these costs are payable regardless of whether or not the Merger is consummated. Litigation has been filed in connection with the Merger, and further litigation may arise prior to closing. Defending the litigation could prove costly and time-consuming.\\n\\nFailure to complete the Merger in a timely manner or at all could negatively impact the market price of our common stock, as well as our future business and our results of operations and financial condition.\\n\\nThe Merger cannot be completed until the conditions to closing are satisfied or (if permissible under applicable law) waived. The failure to satisfy the required conditions could delay the completion of the Merger for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring. Further, there can be no assurance that the conditions to the closing of the Merger will be satisfied or waived or that the Merger will be completed.\\n\\nIf the Merger is not completed in a timely manner or at all, our ongoing business may be adversely affected, including as follows:\\n\\n- we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, and our stock price could decline to the extent that the current market price reflects an assumption that the Merger will be completed;\\n- we may experience negative reactions from employees, guests, suppliers, communities, or other third parties;\\n- we may be subject to further litigation, which could result in significant costs and expenses;\\n- management’s focus may be diverted from our day-to-day business operations and from pursuing other opportunities that could have been beneficial to the Company;\\n- our costs of pursuing the Merger may be higher than anticipated;\\n- we may have difficulties in attracting and/or retaining key employees;\\n- our access to capital markets may be limited and we may experience increased borrowing costs.\\n\\nIf the Merger is not consummated, there can be no assurance that these risks will not materialize and will not materially adversely affect our stock price, business, results of operations, and financial condition.\\n---\\nThe Merger Agreement includes customary termination rights in favor of each party. In certain circumstances, we may be required to pay Alaska a termination fee of $39.6 million in connection with the termination of the Merger Agreement. In certain circumstances, Alaska may be required to pay us a termination fee of $100.0 million. Any requirement to pay a termination fee to Alaska may have an adverse effect on our liquidity and results of operations. The receipt of any termination fee from Alaska may not be sufficient to compensate us for all of the expenses incurred, and opportunities forgone, as a result of our pursuit of the Merger.\\n\\nIn order to complete the Merger, the Company and Alaska must obtain certain regulatory approvals, and if such approvals are not granted or are granted with conditions, completion of the Merger may be jeopardized or the anticipated benefits of the Merger could be reduced.\\n\\nAlthough the Company and Alaska have agreed to use reasonable best efforts, subject to certain limitations, to make certain governmental filings and obtain the required regulatory approvals, there can be no assurance that the relevant approvals will be obtained (including through the expiration of applicable waiting periods). Governmental authorities may also commence litigation against us, Alaska or both to prevent the Merger from occurring. Defending any such lawsuit will be time-consuming and expensive and there can be no assurance that we and Alaska would ultimately be successful.\\n\\nAdditionally, if the Merger is not consummated, our stockholders and holders of RSUs, options, and warrants will not receive the merger consideration that would have been paid at the closing of the Merger.\\n\\n# BUSINESS RISKS\\n\\nOur agreement with Amazon increases the role of cargo in our business model, which may have negative impacts on our operating results and financial condition.\\n\\nOur business has historically focused on passenger flights. The ATSA with Amazon is anticipated to increase our cargo operations. Historically, our revenue from non-passenger operations, which includes cargo, accounted for approximately 9.4%, 11.6%, and 14.1% of total revenue during the years ending December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, our revenue from non-passenger operations accounted for 9.6% of our total revenue. Under the ATSA, cargo operations are expected to account for a larger portion of our revenue. Our cargo operations for Amazon may not generate the levels of revenue anticipated. We expect to incur additional costs in order to ramp up and prepare for increased cargo operations, including hiring crew, opening mainland bases and preparing to provide line maintenance for the Amazon fleet. Our pre-service efforts could be costly and be time-consuming and distracting to our management. Additionally, we will incur costs before we generate revenue from our cargo operations for Amazon, which may negatively impact our business and results of operations. Once we begin generating revenue from cargo operations for Amazon, some or all of that revenue will be offset against the value of Amazon’s vested warrant shares due to our accounting policies.\\n\\n# ECONOMIC RISKS\\n\\nOur business is affected by global economic volatility, including any future economic downturns.\\n\\nOur business and results of operations are significantly impacted by general world-wide economic conditions, including any future economic downturns. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic and associated decline in economic activity and increase in unemployment levels had a severe and prolonged effect on the global economy generally and, in turn, resulted in a prolonged period of depressed demand for air travel in general. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced a significant decrease in demand for air travel and reduced load capacity on flights. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, our passenger revenue was $583.4 million, up approximately $34.9 million compared to 2023, but down $17.9 million, or 3.0% from the pre-pandemic period in 2019. Across our\\n---\\nbusiness and as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have faced operational challenges, including continued delay in the recovery of international travel. Our business depends on the demand for travel to, from and within the Hawaiian Islands and such demand for discretionary air travel remains unpredictable. Further deterioration or instability in demand, including resulting from any future pandemic or other public health related travel restrictions, recommendations or other impacts on travel behavior, such as those that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, ongoing economic uncertainty or recession may result in sustained reduction in our passenger traffic and/or increased competitive pressure on fares in the markets we serve, which could continue to negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance that we will be able to offset passenger revenue reductions with other revenue, by reducing our costs or by seeking financing arrangements or other programs or opportunities. We also may not have sufficient cash flows to support our debt obligations, on which more detail is provided in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, a rapid economic expansion following the height of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significant inflationary pressures and volatility in certain currencies, which have increased our costs for aircraft fuel, wages and other goods and services we require to operate our business.\\n\\nIn 2023, concerns arose with respect to the financial condition of certain banking institutions in the United States, in particular those with exposure to certain types of depositors and large portfolios of investment securities. In March 2023, both Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank (Signature) entered receivership. While we do not maintain accounts with either SVB or Signature, we maintain our cash at other financial institutions in balances that exceed the current Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits. If more banks and financial institutions experience financial hardship, enter receivership or become insolvent in the future due to financial conditions affecting the banking system and financial markets, our ability to access our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments may be threatened and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\\n\\nOur business is highly dependent on tourism to, from, and amongst the Hawaiian Islands and our financial results have been impacted and may continue to be impacted by the current and any future downturn in tourism levels.\\n\\nOur principal base of operations is in Hawai'i and our revenue is linked primarily to the number of travelers (mainly tourists) to, from and amongst the Hawaiian Islands. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and government mandates related to travel, we experienced a significant decline in the demand for travel to, from and amongst the Hawaiian Islands. The State of Hawai'i stopped imposing quarantine, testing and vaccination requirements at the end of the first quarter of 2022, but certain foreign government restrictions remained in effect for international travelers during 2022. We have and will continue to incur costs as we further increase our number of flights as passenger traffic to and within the Hawaiian Islands increases, which we incur before the anticipated additional revenue is earned.\\n\\nHawai'i tourism levels are generally affected by the economic and political climate impacting air travel and tourism markets generally, including the availability of hotel accommodations, the popularity of tourist destinations relative to other vacation destinations, and other global factors including health crises, natural disasters, safety, and security. While we have seen some increased tourism activity in the state of Hawai'i since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot predict if and when tourism levels will be sustained at levels seen prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly with respect to international markets. Additionally, from time to time, various events and industry-specific problems such as labor strikes have had a negative impact on tourism generally and in Hawai'i specifically. The occurrence of natural disasters, such as wildfires, hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and tsunamis, in Hawai'i or other parts of the world, could also have an adverse effect on our business or financial condition. For example, as a result of the August 2023 wildfires in West Maui, we have experienced a decline in tourism in this region that has adversely impacted our business and financial results. We expect demand for travel to Maui to remain depressed and continue to impact our business and financial results while West Maui continues to rebuild from wildfire devastation. In addition, the potential or actual occurrence of terrorist attacks, wars, and/or the threat of other negative world events have had,\\n---\\nand may in the future have, a material adverse effect on or impede the recovery of tourism from the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nOur business is highly dependent on the price and availability of fuel.\\n\\nOur results, operations, and plans for decarbonization are heavily impacted by the price and availability of jet fuel. The cost of jet fuel remains high and the availability of jet fuel remains volatile. The cost and availability of jet fuel are subject to political, economic, and market factors that are generally outside of our control, including those related to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the widening conflict in the Middle East. Prices may be affected by many factors including, without limitation, the impact of political instability, crude oil production and refining capacity, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production volume, unexpected changes in the availability of petroleum products due to disruptions to distribution systems or refineries, unpredicted increases in demand due to weather or the pace of global economic growth, inventory reserve levels of crude oil and other petroleum products, the relative fluctuation between the U.S. dollar and other major currencies, government taxes, regulations and subsidies that change the price or reduce the availability of jet fuel, and the actions of speculators in commodity markets. Because of the effects of these factors on the price and availability of jet fuel, the cost and future availability of fuel cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty. Also, due to the competitive nature of the airline industry, there can be no assurance that we will be able to increase our fares or other fees to sufficiently offset any increase in fuel prices.\\n\\nWhile we may enter into derivative agreements to protect against the volatility of fuel costs, there is no assurance that such agreements will protect us during unfavorable market conditions or that counterparties will be able to perform under these hedge arrangements.\\n\\nSee Item 7A “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 for further information regarding our exposure to the price of fuel.\\n\\nOur business is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\\n\\nPrior to the COVID-19 pandemic, our business had been expanding internationally with an increasing percentage of our passenger revenue generated from our International routes. The fluctuation of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies can significantly affect our results of operations and financial condition. For example, the value of the Japanese Yen has experienced significant volatility versus the U.S. dollar recently. Any weakening of the Japanese Yen relative to the U.S. dollar causes our flights, and travel in general, from Japan to Hawai'i to become more expensive to customers in Japan, which has and could continue to negatively impact our business. To manage the effects of fluctuating exchange rates, we periodically enter into foreign currency forward contracts and execute payment of expenditures in those locations in local currency. As of March 31, 2024, we have Japanese Yen denominated debt totaling $111.4 million. If our business continues to expand internationally, there is no assurance that these agreements will protect us against foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations during unfavorable market conditions or that our counterparties will be able to perform under these hedge arrangements.\\n\\nSee Item 7A “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 for further information regarding our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates.\\n\\nLIQUIDITY RISKS\\n\\nOur financial liquidity could be adversely affected by credit market conditions.\\n\\nOur business requires access to capital markets to finance equipment purchases, including aircraft, and to provide liquidity in seasonal or cyclical periods of weaker revenue generation. In particular, we will face specific funding requirements with respect to our obligation under purchase agreements with Boeing to acquire new aircraft. We may finance these upcoming aircraft deliveries; however, the unpredictability of global credit market conditions,\\n---\\nparticularly in light of the U.S. Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) raising interest rates, may adversely affect the availability of financing or may result in unfavorable terms and conditions.\\n\\n48\\n\\nOur current unencumbered aircraft can be financed to increase our liquidity, but such financings may be subject to unfavorable terms. In light of current market conditions, any such financings are likely to reflect loan-to-value ratios and interest rates and other terms and conditions less favorable than our recent aircraft financings.\\n\\nAdditionally, there can be no assurance that we will not face credit rating downgrades as a result of weaker than anticipated performance of our business or other factors, as demonstrated by our credit rating downgrades in 2020. Future downgrades could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins, liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets.\\n\\nWe can offer no assurance that financing we may need in the future will be available when required or that the economic terms on which it is available will not adversely affect our financial condition. In addition, our ability to refinance our existing or future indebtedness as we may need or desire will depend on the capital markets, including prevailing interest rates, and our financial condition and performance, which, among other things, is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. If we cannot obtain financing, we are unable to refinance our existing or future indebtedness, or we cannot obtain financing or refinance our existing or future indebtedness on commercially reasonable or desirable terms, we may default on our existing or future indebtedness and our business and financial condition may be adversely affected.\\n\\nOur debt could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, and include covenants that impose restrictions on our financial and business operations.\\n\\nAs of March 31, 2024, we had approximately $1.6 billion in outstanding commercial debt, excluding funds borrowed under the federal PSP. Our debt and related covenants could:\\n\\n- require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for other purposes;\\n- limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\\n- limit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in the agreements governing our debt, our ability to borrow additional funds;\\n- place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to other less leveraged competitors and competitors with debt agreements on more favorable terms than us; and\\n- adversely affect our ability to secure additional financing in the future on acceptable terms or at all, which would impact our ability to fund our working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general corporate purpose needs.\\n\\nThese agreements require us to meet certain covenants. If we breach any of these covenants we could be in a default under these facilities, which could cause our outstanding obligations under these facilities to accelerate and become due and payable immediately, and could also cause us to default under our other debt or lease obligations and lead to an acceleration of the obligations related to such other debt or lease obligations. The existence of such a default could also preclude us from borrowing funds under other credit facilities.\\n\\nOur ability to comply with the provisions of financing agreements can be affected by events beyond our control and a default under any such financing agreements if not cured or waived, could have a material adverse effect on us. In the event our debt is accelerated, we may not have sufficient liquidity to repay these obligations or to refinance our debt obligations, resulting in a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\\n\\nWe are required to maintain reserves under our credit card processing agreements which could adversely affect our financial and business operations.\\n---\\nUnder our bank-issued credit card processing agreements, certain proceeds from advance ticket sales may be held back to serve as collateral to cover any possible chargebacks or other disputed charges that may occur. As of March 31, 2024, there were no holdbacks held by our credit card processors.\\n\\nIn the event of a material adverse change in our business, the holdback could incrementally increase to an amount up to 100% of the applicable credit card activity for all unflown flights, which would also cause an increase in the level of restricted cash. If we are unable to obtain a waiver, or otherwise mitigate the increase in restricted cash, it could adversely affect our liquidity and also cause a covenant violation under other debt or lease obligations and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\\n\\nCOMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT RISKS\\n\\nWe operate in an extremely competitive environment.\\n\\nThe airline industry is characterized by low profit margins, high fixed costs, and significant price competition. We compete with other airlines on all of our Domestic and International routes. The commencement of, or increase in, service on our routes by existing or new carriers at aggressive prices has and could continue to negatively impact our operating results, including as demand for air travel rebuilds. Most of our competitors are much larger and have greater financial resources and brand recognition than we do. Moreover, competitors or potential competitors may merge or enter alliances that increase their financial resources and other strategic advantages. Aggressive marketing tactics or a prolonged fare competition initiated by one or more of these competitors could adversely affect our financial resources and our ability to compete in these markets. Additionally, our competitors have been and may continue to be more successful in recovering from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, which could impact our ability to compete successfully in the future. Since airline markets have few natural barriers to entry, we also face the constant threat of new entrants in all of our markets.\\n\\nAdditional capacity to or within Hawai'i, whether from network carriers or low-cost carriers, could decrease our share of the markets in which we operate, could cause a decline in our yields, or both, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\\n\\nInflation may adversely affect us by increasing costs beyond what we can recover through price increases and may contribute to a recession.\\n\\nIn the past year, inflation increased throughout the U.S. economy to levels not seen in decades. Although inflation rates have recently declined, inflation can adversely affect us by increasing the costs of labor, fuel, and other costs as well as by reducing demand for air travel. In an inflationary environment, depending on airline industry and other economic conditions, we may be unable to raise prices enough to keep up with the rate of inflation, which would reduce our profit margins. We have experienced, and continue to experience, increases in the prices of labor, fuel and other costs of providing service. Continued inflationary pressures could further impact our profitability.\\n\\nIn response to inflation, the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates in an effort to reduce inflationary pressures. The Federal Reserve's actions increase the risk of a recession in which demand for air travel is reduced, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\\n\\nInterest rate increases may adversely affect the fair value of our investments\\n\\nThe Federal Reserve's interest rate increases have reduced and could continue to reduce, the fair value of our investments. Reductions in the fair value of our investments could have a negative impact on our earnings and liquidity.\\n---\\nThe concentration of our business within Hawai'i, and between Hawai'i and the U.S. mainland, provides little diversification of our revenue.\\n\\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2024, approximately 77.4% of our passenger revenue was generated from our Domestic routes. Most of our competitors, particularly major network carriers with whom we compete on North America and Neighbor Island routes, enjoy greater geographical diversification of their passenger revenue. As Domestic routes account for a significantly higher proportion of our revenue than they do for most of our competitors, a proportionately higher decline in demand for our domestic routes is likely to have a relatively greater adverse effect on our financial results than on those of our competitors. Sustained reduction in demand on our Domestic routes and continued industry capacity of major network carriers on routes to, from and within Hawai'i could adversely affect our financial results.\\n\\nOur business is affected by the competitive advantages held by network carriers in the North America market.\\n\\nThe majority of competition on our North America routes is from network carriers such as Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines, and United Airlines, all of whom have a number of competitive advantages. Primarily, network carriers generate passenger traffic from and throughout the U.S. mainland, which enables them to attract higher customer traffic levels as compared to us.\\n\\nIn contrast, we lack a comparable direct network to feed passengers to our North America flights and are therefore more reliant on passenger demand in the specific cities we serve. We also rely on our code-share partner agreements (e.g. with JetBlue) to provide customers access to and from North American destinations currently unserved by us. Most network carriers operate from hubs, which can provide a built-in market of passengers depending on the economic strength of the hub city and the size of the customer group that frequents the airline. Our Honolulu and Maui hubs do not originate a large proportion of North American travel, nor do they have the population or potential customer franchise of a larger city to provide us with a significant built-in market. Passengers in the North American market, for the most part, do not originate in Honolulu, but on the U.S. mainland, making Honolulu primarily a destination rather than an origin of passenger traffic.\\n\\nOur North America and Neighbor Island routes are affected by increased capacity provided by our competitors.\\n\\nPrior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic, certain of our competitors increased capacity to and within Hawai'i by introducing new routes and increasing the frequency of existing routes from North America to Hawai'i and by the introduction of additional flights within the neighbor islands. We are unable to predict competitor capacity related to air travel to Hawai'i or between the neighbor islands. Any increased competitor capacity that decreases our share of traffic to Hawai'i or between the neighbor islands could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\\n\\nOur International routes are affected by competition from domestic and foreign carriers.\\n\\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2024, approximately 22.6% of our passenger revenue was generated from our International routes. Our competitors on these routes include both domestic and foreign carriers. Both domestic and foreign competitors have a number of competitive advantages that may enable them to attract higher customer traffic levels as compared to us.\\n\\nMany of our domestic competitors are members of airline alliances, which provide customers access to each participating airline’s international network, allowing for convenience and connectivity to their destinations. These alliances formed by our domestic competitors have increased in recent years. In some instances, our domestic\\n---\\ncompetitors have been granted antitrust exemptions to form joint venture arrangements in certain geographies, further deepening their cooperation on certain routes. To mitigate this risk, we rely on code-share agreements with partner airlines to provide customers access to international destinations currently unserved by us.\\n\\nMany of our foreign competitors are network carriers that benefit from network feed to support international routes on which we compete. In contrast, we lack a comparable direct network to feed passengers to our international flights, and are therefore more reliant on passenger demand in the specific destinations that we serve. Most network carriers operate from hubs, which can provide a built-in home base market of passengers. Passengers on our International routes, for the most part, do not originate in Hawai'i, but rather internationally, in these foreign carriers’ home bases. We also rely on our code-share agreements and our relationships with travel agencies and wholesale distributors to provide customers access to and from International destinations currently unserved by us.\\n\\nINFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND THIRD-PARTY RISKS\\n\\nIf we do not maintain the privacy and security of personal information or other information relating to our customers or others, or fail to comply with applicable U.S. and foreign privacy, data protection, or data security laws or security standards imposed by our commercial partners, our reputation could be damaged, we could incur substantial additional costs, and we could become subject to litigation or regulatory penalties.\\n\\nWe receive, retain, transmit and otherwise process personal information and other information about our customers and other individuals, including our employees and contractors, and we are subject to increasing legislative, regulatory and customer focus on privacy, data protection, and data security both domestically and internationally. Numerous laws and regulations in the U.S. and in various other jurisdictions in which we operate relate to privacy, data protection, and security, including laws and regulations regarding the collection, processing, storage, sharing, disclosure, use and security of personal information and other data from and about our customers and other individuals. For example, in the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) became effective in 2018. The United Kingdom has adopted legislation that substantially implements the GDPR. Additionally, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), effective as of January 1, 2020, which was modified significantly by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), which became effective in most material respects on January 1, 2023. Other states, including Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Montana, New Jersey, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, and Virginia have enacted similar legislation. The U.S. federal government also is contemplating federal privacy legislation. The GDPR and CCPA, other new laws and regulations, and changes in laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection and information security may require us to modify our practices with respect to the collection, use and disclosure of data. The GDPR provides for significant penalties in the case of non-compliance of up to €20 million or four percent of worldwide annual revenues, whichever is greater. The United Kingdom legislation implementing the GDPR provides for a similar penalty structure. The GDPR, CCPA, CPRA and other existing and proposed laws and regulations can be costly to comply with and can delay or impede our processing of data, result in negative publicity, increase our operating costs and subject us to claims or other remedies. The scope of laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and security is changing, subject to differing interpretations, may be costly to comply with, and may be inconsistent among countries and jurisdictions or conflict with other obligations of ours.\\n\\nA number of our commercial partners, including payment card companies, have imposed data security standards or other obligations relating to privacy, data protection, or data security upon us. We strive to comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, and contractual and other legal obligations relating to privacy, data protection, and data security. However, these legal, contractual, and other actual and asserted obligations may be interpreted and applied in new ways and/or in manners that are inconsistent, and may conflict with other obligations or our practices.\\n\\nAny failure or perceived failure by us to comply with laws or regulations, our privacy or data protection policies, or other actual or asserted privacy-, data protection-, or information security-related obligations to customers or other third parties, or any actual or perceived compromise of security resulting in the unauthorized disclosure, transfer,\\n---\\n# Loss, Unavailability, Use, or Other Processing of Information\\n\\nLoss, unavailability, use, or other processing of personal or other information may result in governmental investigations and enforcement actions, governmental or private litigation, other liability, our loss of the ability to process payment card transactions, or us becoming subject to higher costs for such transactions, or public statements critical of us by consumer advocacy groups, competitors, the media or others that could cause our current or prospective customers to lose trust in us, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business. Additionally, if third-party business partners that we work with, such as vendors, violate or are alleged to violate applicable laws, applicable policies or other privacy-, data protection-, or security-related obligations, such violations may also put our customers’ or others’ information at risk and could in turn have an adverse effect on our business. Governmental agencies may also request or take customer data for national security or informational purposes, and also can make data requests in connection with criminal or civil investigations or other matters, which could harm our reputation and our business.\\n\\n# Compliance with Privacy, Data Protection, and Information Security Obligations\\n\\nWe will continue our efforts to comply with new and increasing privacy, data protection, and information security obligations; however, it is possible that such obligations may require us to expend additional resources, and may be difficult or impossible for us to meet. Any actual or alleged failure to comply with applicable U.S. or foreign privacy, data protection, or data security laws or regulations, any privacy or security standards imposed by our commercial partners, or any other actual or asserted obligations relating to privacy, data protection, or information security, may result in claims, regulatory investigations and proceedings, private litigation and proceedings, and other liability, all of which may adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.\\n\\n# Protection of Customer Information\\n\\nOur actual or perceived failure to protect customer information or other personal information or confidential information could result in harm to our business.\\n\\n# Cybersecurity Incidents\\n\\nOur business and operations involve the storage, transmission and processing of information about our customers, our employees and contractors, our business partners, and others, as well as our own confidential information. We have not experienced a material cybersecurity incident, but we have experienced cybersecurity incidents in the past and we may experience cybersecurity incidents in the future, including incidents through cyber-attacks by third parties seeking unauthorized access to any of these types of information or to disrupt our business or operations. Ransomware and other malware, business e-mail compromises, fraudulent sales of frequent flier miles, and general hacking have become more prevalent in our industry. While we have taken steps to protect customer information and other confidential information to which we have access, there can be no assurance that any security measures that we or our third-party service providers have implemented will be effective against current or future security threats. The security risks that we and our third-party service providers face have been heightened by an increase in employees and service providers working remotely. Additionally, these risks may be elevated in connection with geopolitical events such as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the widening conflict in the Middle East. We and our third-party service providers may be unable to anticipate attempted security breaches and to implement adequate preventative measures, and our security measures or those of our third-party service providers could be breached or otherwise compromised, we could suffer data loss, corruption, or unavailability, unauthorized access to or use of the systems or networks used in our business and operations, and unauthorized, accidental, or unlawful access to, or disclosure, modification, misuse, loss, unavailability, destruction, or other unauthorized processing of our or our customers’ information. We may also experience security breaches or other incidents that may remain undetected for an extended period. Further, third parties may also conduct attacks designed to disrupt or deny access to the systems and networks used in our business and operations.\\n\\n# Security Breaches and Incidents\\n\\nActual or perceived security breaches or other security incidents could result in unauthorized use of or access to systems and networks, unauthorized, accidental, or unlawful access to, or disclosure, modification, misuse, loss, unavailability or destruction of, our or our customers’ information, and may lead to litigation, claims, indemnity obligations, regulatory investigations and other proceedings, severe reputational damage adversely affecting customer or investor confidence and causing damage to our brand, indemnity obligations, disruption to our operations, damages for contract breach, and other liability, and may adversely affect our revenues and operating results. Additionally, our service providers may suffer security breaches or other incidents.\\n---\\nthat may result in unauthorized access or otherwise compromise data stored or processed for us that may give rise to any of the foregoing.\\n\\nAny such actual or perceived security breach or other incident may lead to the expenditure of significant financial and other resources in efforts to investigate or correct a breach or other incident, address and eliminate vulnerabilities, and to prevent future security breaches or incidents, as well as significant costs for remediation that may include liability for stolen assets or information and repair of system damage that may have been caused, incentives offered to customers or other business partners in an effort to maintain business relationships after a breach, costs in connection with payment card brand fines, and other liabilities. Certain breaches affecting payment card information or the environment in which such information is processed may also result in a loss of our ability to process payment cards or increased costs associated with doing so. We have incurred and expect to incur ongoing expenditures in an effort to prevent information security breaches and other security incidents.\\n\\nWe cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate for information security liabilities actually incurred or to cover any indemnification claims against us relating to any incident. Furthermore, we cannot be certain that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our financial condition, operating results, and reputation.\\n\\nWe are increasingly dependent on technology and automated systems to operate our business.\\n\\nWe depend heavily on technology and automated systems to effectively operate our business. These systems include flight operations systems, communications systems, airport systems, reservations systems, management and accounting systems, commercial websites, including www.hawaiianairlines.com, and other IT systems, many of which must be able to accommodate high traffic volumes, maintain secure information and provide accurate flight information, as well as process critical financial transactions. Any substantial, extended, or repeated failures of these systems could negatively affect our customer service, compromise the security of customer information or other information stored on, transmitted by, or otherwise processed by these systems, result in the loss of or damage to important data, loss of revenue and increased costs, and generally harm our business. Additionally, loss of key talent required to maintain and advance these systems could have a material impact on our operations. Like other companies, our systems may be vulnerable to disruptions due to events beyond our control, including natural disasters, power disruptions, software or equipment failures, terrorist attacks, cybersecurity incursions, computer viruses and hackers. There can be no assurance that the measures we have taken to reduce the adverse effects of certain potential failures or disruptions are adequate to prevent or remedy disruptions of our systems or prevent or mitigate all attacks. In addition, we will need to continuously make significant investments in technology to periodically upgrade and replace existing systems. If we are unable to make these investments or fail to successfully implement, upgrade or replace our systems, our operations and business could be adversely impacted. For example, in May 2023, a maintenance failure caused a power disruption at our Honolulu internet provider, which interrupted our operations and resulted in significant flight delays and, during our transition to the Amadeus Altéa Passenger Service System in April 2023, we experienced intermittent issues, including issues related to our website, mobile and kiosk passenger check-in capability and booking through our website, which could have a significant impact on our operations. We do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant losses, including the potential harm to our business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation that may result from system interruptions or system failures.\\n\\nWe are highly reliant on third-party contractors to provide certain facilities and services for our operations, and their failure to provide adequate products and services, or the termination of our third-party agreements could have a potentially adverse effect on our financial results.\\n\\nThere are a limited number of qualified employees and personnel in the airline and information technology industry, especially within the Hawai'i market. Due to these limitations, we have historically relied on outside vendors for a variety of services and functions critical to our business, including aircraft maintenance and parts, code-sharing, distribution and reservations, computer services including hosting and software maintenance, accounting, frequent\\n---\\nflyer programs, passenger processing, ground facilities, baggage and cargo handling, personnel training, and the distribution and sale of airline seats. Our reliance on outside vendors may continue to increase in the future.\\n\\nThe failure of any of our third-party service providers to adequately perform their service obligations, or other interruptions of services are likely to reduce our revenues, increase expenses, and/or prevent us from operating our flights and providing other services to our customers. Our reliance on third-party distribution channels means we depend, in part, on their willingness and ability to reach customers and sell ancillary products and services that we offer. Such distribution channels may be more expensive or have less functionality than the distribution channels that we operate. Our business and financial performance\\n\\nwould be materially harmed if our customers believe that any of our, or our contractors', services are unreliable or unsatisfactory.\\n\\nLABOR RELATIONS AND RELATED COSTS RISKS\\n\\nWe are dependent on satisfactory labor relations. Labor costs are a significant component of airline expenses and can substantially impact an airline’s results of operations. A significant portion of our workforce is represented by labor unions. We have entered into collective bargaining agreements with our pilots, mechanical group employees, clerical group employees, flight attendants, and dispatchers. We cannot ensure that future agreements with our employees’ labor unions will be on terms in line with our expectations or comparable to agreements entered into by our competitors, and any future agreements may increase our labor costs or otherwise adversely affect our business. We may make strategic and operational decisions that may require the consent of one or more of these labor unions, and these labor unions could demand additional wages, benefits or other consideration in return for their consent.\\n\\nApplication of state and local laws to our operations may conflict with federal laws, or with the laws of other states and local governments, and may subject us to additional requirements and restrictions, which might affect our relationship with our workforce and cause our expenses to increase. Application of conflicting laws may result in operational disruption or have negative effects on our collective bargaining agreements, and any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with federal, state or local labor laws may lead to litigation.\\n\\nOur operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel and key executives.\\n\\nWe believe that our future success is dependent on the knowledge and expertise of our key executives and highly qualified management, technical, and other personnel. Attracting and retaining such personnel in the airline industry is highly competitive. We cannot be certain that we will be able to retain our key executives or attract other qualified personnel in the future. Any inability to retain our key executives, or other senior technical personnel, or attract and retain additional qualified executives, could have a negative impact on our operations.\\n\\nIn addition, as we rebuild our operations as passenger demand recovers, and expand our operations through the acquisition of new aircraft and introduction of service to new markets, it may be challenging to attract a sufficient number of qualified personnel including pilots, mechanics and other skilled labor. As we compete with other carriers for qualified personnel, we also face the challenge of attracting individuals who embrace our team-oriented, friendly and customer-driven corporate culture. Our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel who embrace our corporate culture could have a negative impact on our reputation and overall operations.\\n\\nSTRATEGY AND BRAND RISKS\\n\\nOur failure to successfully implement our route and network strategy could harm our business. Our route and network strategy (how we determine to deploy our fleet) includes initiatives to increase revenue, decrease costs, mature our network, and improve distribution of our sales channels. It is critical that we execute upon our planned strategy in order for our business to attain economies of scale and to sustain or improve our results\\n---\\nof operations. If we are unable to utilize and fill increased capacity provided by additional aircraft entering our fleet, hire and retain skilled personnel, or secure the required equipment and facilities in a cost-effective manner, we may be unable to successfully develop and grow our new and existing markets, which may adversely affect our business and operations.\\n\\nWe continue to strive toward aggressive cost-containment goals which are an important part of our business strategy to offer the best value to passengers through competitive fares while maintaining acceptable profit margins and return on capital. We believe a lower cost structure will better position us to fund our strategy and take advantage of market opportunities. If we are unable to adequately contain our non-fuel unit costs, our financial results may suffer.\\n\\n54\\n\\nAny damage to our reputation or brand image could adversely affect our business or financial results.\\n\\nMaintaining a good reputation globally is critical to our business. Our reputation or brand image could be adversely impacted by, among other things, any failure to maintain our safety record, our high ethical, social and environmental sustainability practices for all of our operations and activities, our ability to provide on-time operational service to our customers, our impact on the environment, public pressure from investors or policy groups to change our policies, such as initiatives to address climate change, customer perceptions of our advertising campaigns, sponsorship arrangements or marketing programs, or customer perceptions of statements made by us, our employees and executives, agents or other third parties. Damage to our reputation or brand image or loss of customer confidence in our services could adversely affect our business and financial results, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation.\\n\\nWe also increasingly use social media to communicate news and events. The inappropriate and/or unauthorized use of certain platforms or outlets could damage our brand image and reputation, and could lead to a loss of goodwill with our customers and stakeholders. Inappropriate or unauthorized use of social media could have legal implications if, for example, employees improperly collect or disseminate personally identifiable information of employees, customers or other stakeholders. Further, disclosure of our non-public information by our employees or others, whether intentional or unintentional, through social media could lead to information loss.\\n\\nOur intellectual property rights, particularly our brand, are valuable, and any inability to protect them may adversely affect our business and financial results.\\n\\nWe consider our intellectual property rights, particularly our brand and its associated trademarks, to be valuable assets. We protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of trademark, copyright and other forms of legal protection, contractual agreements and policing of third-party misuses of our intellectual property. Our failure to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property or any change in law that reduces or removes the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and adversely impact our business and financial results. Any litigation or disputes regarding intellectual property may be costly and time-consuming and may divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations, either of which may adversely impact our business and financial results.\\n\\nOur reputation and financial results could be harmed in the event of adverse publicity, such as in the event of an aircraft accident or incident, or if we are unable to achieve certain sustainability goals.\\n\\nOur customer base is broad and our business activities have significant prominence, particularly in Hawai'i and other destinations we serve. Consequently, negative publicity, including on social media, resulting from real or perceived shortcomings in our customer service, employee relations, business conduct, third-party aircraft components or other events or circumstances affecting our operations could negatively affect the public image of our company and the willingness of customers to purchase services from us, which could affect our financial results.\\n---\\nAdditionally, we are exposed to potential losses that may be incurred in the event of an aircraft accident or incident. Any such accident or incident involving our aircraft or an aircraft operated by one of our code-share partners could involve not only the repair or replacement of a damaged aircraft or aircraft parts, and its consequential temporary or permanent loss of revenue, but also significant claims of injured passengers and others. We are required by the DOT to carry liability insurance, and although we currently maintain liability insurance in amounts consistent with the industry, we cannot be assured that our insurance coverage will adequately cover us from all claims and we may be forced to bear substantial losses incurred with an accident. In addition, any aircraft accident or incident could cause a public perception that we are less safe or reliable than other airlines, which would harm our business.\\n\\nThe airline industry is also subject to increasing scrutiny for its greenhouse gas emissions and impact on the environment. We are investing and intend to continue to invest towards achieving our environmental goals. While we are working to achieve our environmental goals, our sustainability plans and our ability to execute those sustainability plans are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties, including ongoing support from governments and other third-parties, the need for significant capital investment, and research and development as well as commercialization of new technologies. There can be no guarantee that we can achieve any or all of our environmental goals, and our brand, reputation and financial results may be harmed as a result of our inability to achieve such goals.\\n\\nOur cargo business will be concentrated with Amazon, and any decrease in volumes or increase in costs, or a termination of our commercial agreement with Amazon, could have a significant impact on our business, operations, financial condition and brand.\\n\\nWe expect that a significant portion of our cargo revenue will consist of air cargo transportation services provided to Amazon under the ATSA. The ATSA does not require a minimum amount of volume or revenue and Amazon is permitted to decrease volume at any time. Our cargo business would not achieve its expected financial benefits if Amazon’s use of our cargo services does not reach forecasted levels for any reason, including due to general economic conditions or preferences of Amazon and its customers. Such a shortcoming could significantly impact our business and results of operations.\\n\\nIn addition, the profitability of the ATSA is dependent on our ability to manage and accurately predict costs. Our projections of operating costs, crew productivity and maintenance expenses contain assumptions, including as to flight hours, aircraft reliability, crewmember productivity, compensation and benefits expense, and maintenance costs. If actual costs are higher than projected or aircraft reliability is less than expected, or aircraft become damaged and are out of revenue service for repair, the profitability of the ATSA and future operating results may be negatively impacted. We also rely on flight crews that are unionized. If collective bargaining agreements increase our costs and we cannot recover such increases, our operating results would be negatively impacted.\\n\\nPerformance under the ATSA is subject to a number of challenges and uncertainties, such as: unforeseen maintenance and other costs; our ability to hire pilots and other personnel necessary to support our services; interruptions in the operations under the ATSA as a result of unexpected or unforeseen events, whether as a result of factors within our control or outside of our control; and the level of operations and results of operations, including margins, under the ATSA being less than our current expectations and projections. The ATSA also contains monthly incentive payments for reaching specific on-time arrival performance thresholds, as well as providing for monetary penalties for on-time arrival performance below certain thresholds. As a result, our operating revenues may vary from period to period depending on the achievement of monthly incentives or the imposition of penalties. Further, we could be found in default if we do not maintain certain minimum reliability thresholds over an extended period of time. If we are placed in default due to the failure to maintain reliability thresholds, Amazon may elect to terminate all or part of the services we provide and pursue rights and remedies available to it at law or in equity. The ATSA is also subject to two extension options, which Amazon may choose not to exercise. To the extent that our volume of flying for Amazon is less than we anticipate or costs associated with our cargo business are higher than\\n---\\nwe forecast, or if the ATSA is terminated for any reason, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be significantly and adversely affected.\\n\\nOur agreements with Amazon confer certain termination rights which, if exercised or triggered, may result in our inability to realize the full benefits of the agreements.\\n\\nOur agreements with Amazon give Amazon the option to terminate in certain circumstances and upon the occurrence of certain events of default, including a change of control of Hawaiian or our failure to meet certain performance requirements. In particular, Amazon will have the right to terminate the agreement without cause after March 31, 2027, upon providing us prior written notice of termination and paying an early termination fee.\\n\\nUpon termination, Amazon will generally, subject to certain exceptions, retain the warrants that have vested prior to the time of termination and, depending on the circumstances giving rise to the termination, may have the right to accelerated vesting of the remaining warrants upon a change of control of our company. Upon termination, Amazon or we may also have the right to receive a termination fee from the other party depending on the circumstances giving rise to the right of termination.\\n\\nAn exercise by Amazon of any of these termination rights could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\\n\\nAIRLINE INDUSTRY, REGULATION AND RELATED COSTS RISKS\\n\\nThe airline industry has substantial operating leverage and is affected by many conditions that are beyond its control, which could harm our financial condition and results of operations.\\n\\nDue to the substantial fixed costs associated with operating an airline, there is a disproportionate relationship between the cost of operating each flight and the number of passengers carried. However, the revenue generated from a particular flight is directly related to the number of passengers carried and the respective average fares applied. Accordingly, a decrease in the number of passengers carried and, when applicable, the aggregate effect of decreasing flights scheduled, causes a corresponding decrease in revenue that is likely to result in a disproportionately greater decrease in profits. Therefore, any future reductions in airline passenger traffic as a result of the following or other factors, which are largely outside of our control, will likely harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations:\\n\\n- decline in general economic conditions;\\n- threat of terrorist attacks and conflicts overseas;\\n- actual or threatened war and political instability;\\n- increased security measures or breaches in security;\\n- adverse weather and natural disasters, such as the Maui wildfires;\\n- changes in consumer preferences, perceptions, or spending patterns;\\n- increased costs related to security and safety measures;\\n- increased fares as a result of increases in fuel costs;\\n- outbreaks of contagious diseases or fear of contagion that affect travel behavior, such as occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic; and\\n- congestion or major construction at airports and actual or potential disruptions in the air traffic control system.\\n\\nOur results of operations are and may continue to be volatile due to the conditions identified above. We cannot ensure that our financial resources will be sufficient to absorb the effects of any unexpected events, including those identified above.\\n---\\n# Our operations may be disrupted if we are unable to obtain and maintain adequate facilities and infrastructure at airports within the state of Hawai'i.\\n\\nWe must be able to maintain and/or obtain adequate gates, maintenance capacity, office space, operations areas, and ticketing facilities, especially at airports within the state of Hawai'i, to be able to operate our existing and proposed flight schedules. Failure to maintain such facilities and infrastructure may adversely impact our operations and financial performance.\\n\\n# Our business is subject to substantial seasonal and cyclical volatility.\\n\\nOur results of operations reflect the impact of seasonal volatility primarily due to passenger leisure and holiday travel patterns. Because of fluctuations in our results from seasonality, operating results for a historical period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future period and operating results for an interim period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year. Moreover, due to the widespread impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the demand for air travel generally and travel to and within Hawai'i specifically, we have seen significant declines in demand for air travel in fiscal years 2020 through 2023, as compared to the years before the COVID-19 pandemic. As Hawai'i is a popular vacation destination, demand from North America, our largest source of visitors, is typically stronger during the months of June, July, August and December and considerably weaker at other times of the year. Because of fluctuations in our results from seasonality, operating results for a historical period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future period and operating results for an interim period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year.\\n\\n# Our cargo operations are also subject to seasonal volatility.\\n\\nGlobal trade flows are typically seasonal in nature, with peak activity during the retail holiday season. Demand for air cargo capacity is historically low following the seasonal holiday peak in the fourth quarter of the previous year. While we expect our revenues to fluctuate seasonally, a significant proportion of the costs associated with our cargo business, such as crew salaries and benefits, facilities and overhead costs, cannot easily be reduced to match the seasonal drop in demand. Because of fluctuations in our results from seasonality, operating results for a historical period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for a future period and operating results for an interim period are not necessarily indicative of operating results for an entire year.\\n\\n# Terrorist attacks or international hostilities, or the fear of terrorist attacks or hostilities, even if not made directly on the airline industry, could negatively affect us and the airline industry.\\n\\nTerrorist attacks, even if not made directly on the airline industry, or the fear of such attacks, hostilities or acts of war, could adversely affect the airline industry, including us, and could result in a significant decrease in demand for air travel, increased security costs, increased insurance costs covering war-related risks, and increased flight operational loss due to cancellations and delays. Any future terrorist attacks or the implementation of additional security-related fees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and on the airline industry in general.\\n\\n# The airline industry is subject to extensive government regulation, new regulations, and taxes which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\\n\\nAirlines are subject to extensive regulatory requirements that result in significant costs. New, and modifications to existing, laws, regulations, taxes and airport rates, and charges imposed by domestic and foreign governments have been proposed from time to time that could significantly increase the cost of airline operations, restrict operations or reduce revenue. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) from time to time issues directives and other regulations relating to the maintenance and operation of aircraft that require significant expenditures. Some FAA requirements cover, among other things, retirement of older aircraft, security measures, aircraft landing safety measures, including with respect to the interaction of aircraft systems with new technologies such as 5G C-band service, collision avoidance systems, airborne windshear avoidance systems, noise\\n---\\nabatement and other environmental concerns, commuter aircraft safety and increased inspections, and maintenance procedures to be conducted on older aircraft. A failure to be in compliance, or a modification, suspension or revocation of any of our DOT/FAA authorizations or certificates, would have a material adverse impact on our operations.\\n\\nIn 2018, Congress passed a five-year funding authorization for the FAA which was scheduled to expire in September 2023, and has been extended through May 10, 2024. The legislative process to renew this authorization (the FAA Reauthorization) could impact us, and the airline industry more generally, in numerous ways. As part of the FAA Reauthorization, Congress could seek to impose new rules or regulations concerning, among other things, customer service and consumer protection, aviation safety, labor requirements, investments in FAA staffing and resources and improvements to the air traffic control system, as well as new or increased fees or taxes intended to fund these policies. Any new or enhanced requirements resulting from the FAA Reauthorization have the potential to increase our costs or impact our operations.\\n\\nWe cannot predict the impact that laws or regulations may have on our operations, nor can we ensure that laws or regulations enacted in the future will not adversely affect our business. Further, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain necessary governmental approvals. Once obtained, operating permits are subject to modification and revocation by the issuing agencies. Compliance with these and any future regulatory requirements could require us to incur significant capital and operating expenditures.\\n\\nIn addition to extensive government regulations, the airline industry is dependent on certain services provided by government agencies (DOT, FAA, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA)). Furthermore, because of significantly higher security and other costs incurred by airports since September 11, 2001, many airports have significantly increased their rates and charges to airlines, including us, and may continue to do so in the future. In addition to passenger security requirements, the TSA has adopted comprehensive regulations governing air cargo transportation, covering things like cargo screening and security clearances for people with access to cargo. Additional measures have been proposed, which, if adopted, may have an adverse impact on our ability to efficiently process cargo and could increase our costs.\\n\\nWe are subject to risks associated with climate change, including increased regulation of our CO2 emissions and the potential increased impacts of severe weather events on our operations and infrastructure.\\n\\nThere is increasing global regulatory focus on climate change and emissions of greenhouse gases, including CO2. In particular, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has adopted rules such as the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), which is a market-based emissions offset program. Although the U.S. federal government has not yet enacted legislation to mandate that U.S. airlines participate in CORSIA, we are currently monitoring our international emissions for reporting purposes, and such data will be used in calculations to determine subsequent carbon offsetting requirements under the CORSIA program. At this time, we cannot predict the costs of complying with any future obligations under the CORSIA program. Regardless of the method of regulation or application of CORSIA, further policy changes with regard to climate change are possible, which could increase operating costs in the airline industry and, as a result, adversely affect our operations.\\n\\nIn the event that CORSIA does not come into force as expected, we and other airlines could become subject to an unpredictable and inconsistent array of national or regional emissions restrictions, creating a patchwork of complex regulatory requirements that may affect global competitors differently. Concerns over climate change may result in the adoption of municipal, state, regional, and federal requirements or in changing business environments that may result in increased costs to the airline industry and us. In addition, several countries and U.S. states have adopted or are considering adopting programs to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. On January 20, 2021, the United States rejoined the Paris Climate Accord and the current Presidential administration has made climate change mitigation an important policy priority. For example, on September 9, 2021, the current Presidential administration launched the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge to scale up the production of SAF, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from aviation by 20% by 2030. Additionally, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency pressed for\\n---\\nambitious new aircraft greenhouse gas emission standards at international negotiations organized by ICAO in 2022. The current Presidential administration may adopt additional regulatory changes that could impact the airline industry and our business. Moreover, certain airports have adopted, and others could in the future adopt, greenhouse gas emission or climate-neutral goals that could impact our operations or require us to make changes or additional investments in our infrastructure.\\n\\nAll such climate change-related regulatory activity and developments may adversely affect our business and financial results by requiring us to reduce our emissions, make capital investments to modernize aspects of our operations, purchase carbon offset credits, or otherwise pay for our emissions. Such activity may also impact us indirectly by increasing our operating costs, including fuel costs. We may not be able to increase revenue in proportion with such additional costs.\\n\\nWe could incur significant costs to improve the climate resiliency of our infrastructure and otherwise prepare for, respond to, and mitigate such physical effects of climate change. We could also experience significant operational disruption, reduced demand and increased costs as a result of increases in the frequency, severity or duration of natural disasters, such as wildfires, like the August 2023 wildfires in West Maui, and severe weather events, like hurricanes, exacerbated by climate change. Such severe weather events may increase the incidence of delays and cancellations, increase turbulence-related injuries, impact fuel consumption to avoid weather, require repositioning of aircraft to avoid damage or accommodate changed flights, or reduce demand for travel. We are not able to accurately predict the materiality of any potential losses or costs associated with the physical effects of climate change.\\n\\nFederal budget constraints may adversely affect our industry, business, results of operations and financial position.\\n\\nMany of our airline operations are regulated by governmental agencies, including the FAA, the DOT, the CBP, the TSA, and others. If a failure by the federal government to reach budgetary consensus for fiscal year 2024, or future periods, results in mandatory furloughs and/or other budget constraints, our business and results of operations could be materially negatively impacted, including as a result of actual or potential disruption in the air traffic control system, actual or perceived delays at various airports, and delays in deliveries of new aircraft, which may materially adversely impact our industry, our business, results of operations and financial positions.\\n\\nThe airline industry is required to comply with various environmental laws and regulations, which could inhibit our ability to operate and could also have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\\n\\nMany aspects of airlines’ operations are subject to increasingly stringent federal, state, local, and foreign laws protecting the environment. U.S. federal laws that have a particular impact on us include the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990, the Clean Air Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response Act and the Compensation and Liability Act. Compliance with these and other environmental laws and regulations can require significant expenditures, and violations can lead to significant fines and penalties. Governments globally are increasingly focusing on the environmental impact caused by the consumption of fossil fuels and as a result have proposed or enacted legislation which may increase the cost of providing airline service or restrict its provision. We expect the focus on environmental matters to increase.\\n\\nConcern about climate change and greenhouse gases may result in additional regulation of aircraft emissions in the U.S. and abroad. In addition, other legislative or regulatory action to regulate greenhouse gas emissions is possible. At this time, we cannot predict whether any such legislation or regulation would apportion costs between one or more jurisdictions in which we operate flights. We are monitoring and evaluating the potential impact of such legislative and regulatory developments. In addition to direct costs, such regulation may have a greater effect on the airline industry through increases in fuel costs. The impact to us and our industry from such actions is likely to be\\n---\\nadverse and could be significant, particularly if regulators were to conclude that emissions from commercial aircraft cause significant harm to the atmosphere or have a greater impact on climate change than other industries.\\n\\nOur operations may be adversely affected by our expansion into non-U.S. jurisdictions and the related laws and regulations to which we are subject.\\n\\nThe expansion of our operations into non-U.S. jurisdictions has expanded the scope of the laws and regulations to which we are subject, both domestically and internationally. Compliance with the laws and regulations of foreign jurisdictions and the restrictions on operations that these laws, regulations or other government actions may impose could significantly increase the cost of airline operations or reduce revenue. For example, various jurisdictions have imposed or are currently imposing restrictions that impede or restrict travel in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and certain of our destinations in Asia have been revising their privacy and consumer laws and regulations. Limitations placed on our business as a result of these or other laws and regulations or failure to comply with evolving laws or regulations could result in significant penalties, criminal charges, costs to defend ourselves in a foreign jurisdiction, restrictions on operations and reputational damage. In addition, we operate flights on international routes regulated by treaties and related agreements between the U.S. and foreign governments, which are subject to change as they may be amended from time to time. Modifications of these arrangements could result in an inability to obtain or retain take-off or landing slots for our routes, route authorization and necessary facilities. Any limitations, additions or modifications to government treaties, agreements, regulations, laws or policies related to our International routes could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.\\n\\nWe may be party to litigation or regulatory action in the normal course of business or otherwise, which could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial results.\\n\\nFrom time to time, we are a party to or otherwise involved in legal or regulatory proceedings, claims, government inspections, investigations or other legal matters, both domestically and in foreign jurisdictions, including proceedings related to the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, despite the removal of COVID-19 vaccine requirements as a condition of employment, we continue to be subject to related civil lawsuits and employee grievances that may give rise to legal liability. We believe we have meritorious defenses and intend to vigorously contest such claims. Resolving or defending legal matters, however, can take months or years. The duration of such matters can be unpredictable with many variables that we do not control including adverse party or government responses. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to significant uncertainty and may be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to our operations. In addition, an adverse resolution of a lawsuit, regulatory matter, investigation or other proceeding could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We may be required to change or restrict our operations or be subject to injunctive relief, significant compensatory damages, punitive damages, penalties, fines or disgorgement of profits, none of which may be covered by insurance. We may have to pay out settlements that also may not be covered by insurance. There can be no assurance that any of these payments or actions will not be material. In addition, publicity of ongoing legal and regulatory matters may adversely affect our reputation.\\n\\nChanges in tax laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial conditions.\\n\\nThe rules dealing with U.S. federal, state and local income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (the Treasury) and state and local tax authorities. Changes in U.S. tax laws or their interpretations (which may have retroactive application) could materially increase the amount of taxes we owe, thereby negatively impacting our results of operations as well as our cash flows from operations. For example, the U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act, which, among other changes, implements a 1% excise tax on certain stock buybacks and a 15% alternative minimum tax on adjusted financial statement income of certain companies. Furthermore, our implementation of new practices and processes designed to comply with changing tax laws and regulations could require us to make substantial\\n---\\nchanges to our business practices, allocate additional resources, and increase our costs, potentially adversely impacting our business, financial position and results of operations.\\n\\nAs we continue to grow internationally, we may also be subject to taxation in jurisdictions around the world with increasingly complex tax laws, the application of which may be uncertain. The amount of taxes we pay in these jurisdictions could increase substantially as a result of changes in the applicable tax principles, including increased tax rates, new tax laws or revised interpretations of existing tax laws and precedents, potentially adversely affecting our liquidity and results of operations. For example, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development proposed a global minimum tax of 15%, which has been adopted by the European Union effective January 1, 2024. In addition, the authorities in these jurisdictions could review our tax returns and impose additional tax, interest and penalties, and the relevant authorities could claim that various withholding requirements apply to us or assert that benefits of tax treaties are not available to us or our subsidiaries, any of which could adversely impact us and our results of operations.\\n\\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\\n\\nAs of March 31, 2024, we had NOLs available to reduce future taxable income of approximately $451.4 million for federal income tax purposes pat have indefinite carryover, but are limited to 80% utilization, and approximately $968.8 million for state income tax purposes pat will expire, if unused, beginning in 2024. The majority of our state NOLs relate to pe state of Hawai'i, most of which have indefinite carryover, but are limited to 80% utilization.\\nOur ability to use our NOLs will depend on pe amount of taxable income generated in future periods. If our financial results continue to be adversely impacted, pere can be no assurance pat an increase in pe valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets will not be required in pe future. Such valuation allowance could be material. Additionally, due to our ongoing financial recovery, pe NOLs may expire before we can generate sufficient taxable income to use pem.\\nDuring pe first quarter of 2024, we determined pat it is no longer more-likely-pan-not pat our deferred tax assets will be fully realized based on expected sources of future taxable income. As a result, we increased our valuation allowance resulting in pe reduction of our annual effective tax rate to approximately 10.0%.\\nUnder Section 382 of pe Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” pe corporation’s ability to use its pre-change NOLs to offset its post-change income may be limited. In general, an “ownership change” will occur if pere is a cumulative change in our ownership by “5-percent shareholders” pat exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling pree-year period. Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. Our ability to use NOLs to reduce future taxable income and liabilities may be subject to annual limitations as a result of prior ownership changes and ownership changes pat may occur in pe future.\\n\\nOur insurance costs are susceptible to significant increases, and further increases in insurance costs or reductions in coverage could have an adverse effect on our financial results.\\n\\nWe carry types and amounts of insurance customary in the airline industry, including coverage for general liability, passenger liability, property damage, aircraft loss or damage, baggage and cargo liability, and workers’ compensation. We are required by the DOT to carry liability insurance on each of our aircraft. We currently maintain commercial airline insurance with a major group of independent insurers that regularly participate in world aviation insurance markets, including public liability insurance and coverage for losses resulting from the physical destruction or damage to our aircraft. However, there can be no assurance that the amount of such coverage will not change or that we will not bear substantial losses from accidents or damage to, or loss of, aircraft or other property due to other factors such as natural disasters. We could incur substantial claims resulting from an accident or damage to, or loss of, aircraft or other property due to other factors such as natural disasters in excess of related\\n---\\ninsurance coverage that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, increases in our policy premiums as our policies become eligible for renewal.\\n\\nExtended interruptions or disruptions in service have and could continue to have a material adverse impact on our operations.\\n\\nOur financial results have been and may continue to be adversely affected by factors outside our control, including, but not limited to, flight cancellations, significant delays in operations, and facility disruptions. Our principal base of operations is in Hawai'i and a significant interruption or disruption in service has had and may continue to have a serious impact on our business and results of operations. In addition to international health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, natural disasters, such as hurricanes, earthquakes and tsunamis, have in the past and may again impact the demand for transportation in the markets in which we operate.\\n\\n# FLEET AND FLEET-RELATED RISKS\\n\\nWe are dependent on our limited number of suppliers for aircraft, aircraft engines and parts.\\n\\nWe are dependent on a limited number of suppliers (e.g. Airbus, Boeing, Pratt & Whitney, Rolls Royce) for aircraft, aircraft engines, and aircraft-related items. We are vulnerable to malfunction, failure, recall or other problems associated with the supply and performance of these aircraft and parts and/or related operational disruptions, such as those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and recalls of Pratt & Whitney engines used on our A321neo aircraft due to contamination in the powdered metal used to manufacture certain engine parts. Certain of our suppliers have experienced and continue to experience significant supply chain disruptions. We have experienced delays and part shortages from our suppliers and may experience additional delays and part shortages in the future. These disruptions have and may continue to have a negative impact on our operations, including for example, aircraft out of service due to part unavailability. During 2023, we experienced shortages of Pratt & Whitney engines that resulted in aircraft out of service, and we expect these challenges to continue into 2024 and potentially beyond. We do not yet know the full impact of these operational disruptions resulting from our engine shortages from Pratt & Whitney and its affiliates. We believe that such disruptions could result in reputational harm, increased parts and maintenance costs, increased aircraft down time, and adverse effects on our financial position and results of operations.\\n\\nOur agreements to purchase Boeing 787-9 aircraft represent significant future financial commitments and operating costs. As of March 31, 2024, we had the following firm order commitments and purchase rights for additional aircraft:\\n\\n|Aircraft Type|Firm Orders|Purchase Rights|Expected Delivery Dates|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|A321neo aircraft|-|9|N/A|\\n|Boeing 787-9 aircraft|11|8|Between 2024 and 2027|\\n\\nWe have made substantial pre-delivery payments for aircraft under existing purchase agreements and are required to continue these pre-delivery payments as well as make payments for the balance of the purchase price through delivery of each aircraft. In December 2022, we entered into a supplemental agreement to our Boeing 787-9 purchase agreement with the Boeing Company, pursuant to which (a) we agreed with the Boeing Company to defer the delivery of our Boeing 787-9 aircraft, the first of which we initially expected to receive in the fourth quarter of 2023, with the remaining deliveries scheduled through 2027, and (b) we agreed to exercise purchase options for an additional two Boeing 787-9 aircraft with scheduled delivery dates in 2027. In July 2023, we were notified by Boeing that our 2023 and 2024 Boeing 787-9 deliveries will be delayed by a couple of months. In February 2024, we took delivery of our first Boeing 787-9 aircraft, which was placed into\\n---\\nservice in April 2024. In April 2024, we received delivery of our second Boeing 787-9 aircraft and anticipate delivery of our third aircraft in late 2024. We have, and may continue to experience delays in the delivery of our future Boeing 787-9 aircraft deliveries.\\n\\nThese future commitments substantially increase our future capital spending requirements and may require us to increase our level of debt in future years. We are continuing to evaluate our options to finance these commitments. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing on favorable terms, or at all.\\n\\nDelays in scheduled aircraft deliveries or other loss of fleet capacity may adversely impact our operations and financial results.\\n\\nThe success of our business depends on, among other things, the ability to effectively operate a certain number and type of aircraft. As noted above, we are uncertain about the future of our contractual commitments to purchase additional aircraft for our fleet and have and may continue to experience supply chain delays that impact the availability of our aircraft. Our inability to purchase and introduce new aircraft into our fleet could negatively impact our business, operations and financial performance. Even if we proceed with some or all of our contractual commitments to purchase additional aircraft, delays in scheduled aircraft or our failure to integrate newly purchased aircraft into our fleet as planned may require us to utilize our existing fleet longer than expected. Such extensions may require us to operate existing aircraft beyond the point at which it is economically optimal to retire them, resulting in increased maintenance costs.\\n\\nWe may never realize the full value of our long-lived assets such as aircraft and non-aircraft equipment, resulting in impairment and other related charges that may negatively impact our financial position and results of operations.\\n\\nLong-lived assets used in operations consist principally of property and equipment and had a carrying value of approximately $2.1 billion as of March 31, 2024. Economic and intrinsic triggers, which include extreme fuel price volatility, an uncertain economic and credit environment, unfavorable trends in historical or forecasted results of operations and cash flows, as well as other uncertainties, may cause us to record material impairments of our long-lived assets. Additionally, we could be subject to impairment charges in the future that could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations in future periods.\\n\\nLong-lived assets are tested for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate, in management's judgement, that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amount. To determine whether impairment exists for aircraft used in operations, assets are grouped at the fleet-type level (the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows) and future cash flows are estimated based on projections of capacity, passenger mile yield, fuel costs, labor costs and other relevant factors. If, at any time, management determines the net carrying value of an asset is not recoverable, the amount is reduced to its fair value during the period in which such determination is made.\\n\\nWe continue to evaluate our current fleet and other long-lived assets for impairment accordingly. As of March 31, 2024, our remaining long-lived assets continued to generate future cash flows from operation of the fleet through the respective retirement dates in excess of their respective carrying values.\\n\\nCOMMON STOCK RISKS\\n\\nOur share price is subject to fluctuations.\\n\\nThe market price of our stock is influenced by many factors, many of which are outside of our control, and include other factors discussed in the Risk Factors section, as well as the following:\\n\\n- our operating results and financial condition;\\n---\\n•how our operating results and financial condition compare to securities analyst expectations, particularly with respect to metrics for which we do not give guidance, including whether those results significantly fail to meet or exceed securities analyst expectations;\\n\\n•changes in the competitive environment in which we operate;\\n\\n•fuel price volatility including the availability of fuel;\\n\\n•announcements concerning our competitors including bankruptcy filings, mergers, restructurings or acquisitions by other airlines;\\n\\n•increases or changes in government regulation;\\n\\n•general and industry specific market conditions;\\n\\n•changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts; and\\n\\n•sales of our common stock or other actions by investors with significant shareholdings.\\n\\nIn recent years the stock market has experienced volatile price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies. These market fluctuations, as well as general economic conditions, have affected and may continue to affect the price of our common stock.\\n\\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against a company following periods of volatility in its stock price. This type of litigation, if filed against us, could result in substantial costs and divert our management's attention and resources. In addition, the future sale of a substantial number of shares of common stock by us or by our existing stockholders may have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock. There can be no assurance that the trading price of our common stock will remain at or near its current level.\\n\\nWe do not expect to repurchase our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program or pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future.\\n\\nYou should not rely on an investment in our common stock to provide dividend income. Although we have historically issued quarterly dividends and repurchased shares, we do not currently anticipate any future dividends or share repurchases and we cannot provide any assurance that we will initiate any dividend or a share repurchase program again in the future. Accordingly, investors may need to rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any return on their investment. Our decision whether to declare dividends or institute a share repurchase program could be based on, amongst other things, our operating results, financial condition, capital requirements, and general business conditions.\\n\\nOur future earnings and earnings per share, as reported under generally accepted accounting principles, will be impacted by the Amazon warrants.\\n\\nThe warrants held by Amazon are subject to fair value measurements during periods that they are outstanding. Accordingly, future fluctuations in the fair value of the warrants are expected to adversely impact our reported earnings measures from time to time. See Note 11 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements of this report for further information about the warrants issued to Amazon.\\n\\nIf Amazon or the Treasury exercise their rights to acquire shares of our common stock pursuant to the outstanding warrants held by them, such exercise will dilute the ownership interests of our then-existing stockholders and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\\n\\nIf Amazon or the Treasury exercise their rights to acquire shares of our common stock pursuant to their warrants, it will dilute the ownership interests of our then-existing stockholders and reduce our earnings per share. In addition, any sales in the public market of any common stock issuable upon the exercise of the warrants by Amazon or the Treasury, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. Moreover, the warrants include anti-dilution adjustments for certain issuances of common stock or\\n---\\nconvertible securities by us. If such anti-dilution adjustments are made, Amazon would receive more shares for the exercise of its warrants than before the anti-dilution adjustment, increasing their dilutive impact.\\n\\nOur certificate of incorporation includes a provision limiting voting and ownership by non-U.S. citizens and our bylaws include a provision specifying an exclusive forum for stockholder disputes.\\n\\nTo comply with restrictions imposed by federal law on foreign ownership of U.S. airlines, our certificate of incorporation restricts voting of shares of our common stock by non-U.S. citizens. Our certificate of incorporation provides that the failure of non-U.S. citizens to register their shares on a separate stock record, which we refer to as the “foreign stock record,” would result in a suspension of their voting rights in the event that the aggregate foreign ownership of the outstanding common stock exceeds the foreign ownership restrictions imposed by federal law.\\n\\nOur certificate of incorporation further provides that no shares of our common stock will be registered on the foreign stock record if the amount so registered would exceed the foreign ownership restrictions imposed by federal law. If it is determined that the amount registered in the foreign stock record exceeds the foreign ownership restrictions imposed by federal law, shares will be removed from the foreign stock record in reverse chronological order based on the date of registration therein, until the number of shares registered therein does not exceed the foreign ownership restrictions imposed by federal law. As of March 31, 2024, we believe we were in compliance with the foreign ownership rules.\\n\\nOur bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if such court lacks jurisdiction, any other state or federal court located in the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of us; (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our current or former directors, officers, stockholders or other employees to us or our stockholders; (iii) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors, officers, stockholders or other employees arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or our certificate of incorporation or bylaws (as each may be amended or restated from time to time); or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors, officers or other employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Our amended and restated bylaws further provide that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Accordingly, stockholders may be limited in the forum in which they are able to pursue legal actions against us.\\n\\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and our issuance of warrants to Amazon, may delay or prevent a change of control, which could materially adversely affect the price of our common stock.\\n\\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make it difficult to remove our Board of Directors and management, and may discourage or delay a change of control, which could materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock. These provisions include, among others:\\n\\n- the ability of our Board of Directors to issue, without further action by the stockholders, series of undesignated preferred stock, or rights to acquire preferred stock, that could dilute the interest of, or impair the voting power of, holders of our common stock or could also be used as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control;\\n- advance notice procedures for stockholder proposals to be considered at stockholders’ meetings and for nominations of candidates for election to our Board of Directors;\\n- the ability of our Board of Directors to fill vacancies on the board;\\n- a prohibition against stockholders taking action by written consent;\\n- a prohibition against stockholders calling special meetings of stockholders; and\\n- super-majority voting requirements to modify or amend specified provisions of our certificate of incorporation.\\n---\\n# SECURITIES OFFERINGS RISKS\\n\\nIn connection with the issuance of Hawaiian’s enhanced equipment trust certificate, our indebtedness and liabilities could limit the cash flow available for our operations, and consequently expose us to risks that could materially adversely affect the resources available to us and Hawaiian to satisfy our obligations under such certificates.\\n\\nAs of March 31, 2024, the outstanding principal balance of our enhanced equipment trust certificate (EETC) issuances was $153.1 million. Offerings of structured finance securities, such as the EETC issuances may present risks similar to those of the other types of debt obligations in which we or Hawaiian may invest and, in fact, such risks may be of greater significance in the case of such structured finance securities. In addition, the performance of the EETCs will be affected by a variety of factors, including its priority in the capital structure of the issuer thereof, and the availability of any credit enhancement, the level and timing of payments and recoveries on and the characteristics of the underlying receivables, loans or other assets that are being securitized, remoteness of those assets from the originator or transferor, the adequacy of and ability to realize upon any related collateral and the capability of the servicer of the securitized assets. If we or Hawaiian fail to comply with these covenants or to make payments under such indebtedness when due, then we or Hawaiian would be in default under that indebtedness, which could, in turn, result in ours or Hawaiian’s other indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full.\\n\\nIn connection with the issuance of the senior secured notes due 2026, our indebtedness and liabilities could limit the cash flow available for Hawaiian’s operations, and consequently expose us to risks that could materially adversely affect the resources available to us to satisfy our obligations under the Notes.\\n---\\nIn February 2021, we conducted a private offering of 5.75% senior secured notes due 2026 (the Notes) collateralized by certain loyalty and brand assets (Notes Offering). The indebtedness of Hawaiian and its subsidiaries increased significantly as a result of the Notes Offering. As of March 31, 2024, Hawaiian had approximately $1.7 billion of total indebtedness (excluding finance lease obligations of approximately $65.1 million and operating lease obligations of $363.1 million). We incurred approximately $1.2 billion principal amount of indebtedness as a result of the Notes Offering. We may also incur additional indebtedness to meet future financing needs. The indebtedness of Hawaiian and its subsidiaries could have significant negative consequences for our security holders and the resources available to satisfy our obligations under the Notes, including the following:\\n\\n- greater difficulty satisfying our obligations with respect to the Notes;\\n- increasing Hawaiian’s vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\\n- limiting Hawaiian’s ability to obtain additional financing;\\n- requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of Hawaiian’s cash flow from operations to service Hawaiian’s indebtedness, which will reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes;\\n- limiting Hawaiian’s flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in its business;\\n- placing Hawaiian at a possible competitive disadvantage with competitors that are less leveraged than us or have better access to capital; and\\n- potentially causing Hawaiian’s credit ratings to be reduced and causing our and Hawaiian’s debt and equity securities to significantly decrease in value.\\n\\nHawaiian’s business, including the HawaiianMiles Program, may not generate sufficient funds, and we and Hawaiian may otherwise be unable to maintain sufficient cash reserves, to pay amounts due under our and Hawaiian’s indebtedness, including the Notes, and our and Hawaiian’s cash needs may increase in the future. In addition, future indebtedness that we or Hawaiian may incur may contain financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to operate our business, including with respect to the HawaiianMiles Program, raise capital or make payments under our or Hawaiian’s indebtedness. If we or Hawaiian fail to comply with these covenants or to make payments under ours or Hawaiian’s indebtedness when due, then we or Hawaiian would be in default under that indebtedness, which could, in turn, result in ours and Hawaiian’s other indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full.\\n\\nITEM 2.

Exhibits\\n\\n# Table of Contents\\n\\nForward-Looking Information\\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the \\\"Report\\\") contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \\\"Securities Act\\\"), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \\\"Exchange Act\\\"). All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this Report are forward-looking statements. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as \\\"expects,\\\" \\\"plans,\\\"\\n---\\n\\\"intends,\\\" \\\"anticipates,\\\" \\\"indicates,\\\" \\\"remains,\\\" \\\"believes,\\\" \\\"estimates,\\\" \\\"forecast,\\\" \\\"guidance,\\\" \\\"outlook,\\\" \\\"may,\\\" \\\"will,\\\" \\\"should,\\\" \\\"seeks,\\\" \\\"goals,\\\" \\\"targets\\\" or the negative of these terms or other similar expressions. Additionally, forward-looking statements include statements that do not relate solely to historical facts, such as statements which identify uncertainties or trends, discuss the possible future effects of current known trends or uncertainties, or which indicate that the future effects of known trends or uncertainties cannot be predicted, guaranteed, or assured. Forward-looking statements contained in this Report include, without limitation, statements regarding our outlook and future results of operations and financial position, our business strategy and plans for future operations, our sustainability initiatives, the impact of industry or other macroeconomic trends affecting our business, seasonality, and our expectations regarding the wind-down of our Northeast Alliance with American Airlines Group Inc. (the \\\"NEA\\\") and the related impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Forward-looking statements involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and are based on information currently available to us. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements due to many factors, including, without limitation, the risk associated with the execution of our strategic operating plans in the near-term and long-term; our extremely competitive industry; risks related to the long-term nature of our fleet order book; volatility in fuel prices and availability of fuel; increased maintenance costs associated with fleet age; costs associated with salaries, wages and benefits; risks associated with a potential material reduction in the rate of interchange reimbursement fees; risks associated with doing business internationally; our reliance on high daily aircraft utilization; our dependence on the New York metropolitan market; risks associated with extended interruptions or disruptions in service at our focus cities; risks associated with airport expenses; risks associated with seasonality and weather; our reliance on a limited number of suppliers for our aircraft, engines, and our Fly-Fi® product; risks related to new or increased tariffs imposed on commercial aircraft and related parts imported from outside the United States; the outcome of legal proceedings with respect to the NEA and our wind-down of the NEA; risks associated with cybersecurity and privacy, including information security breaches; heightened regulatory requirements concerning data security compliance; risks associated with reliance on, and potential failure of, automated systems to operate our business; our inability to attract and retain qualified crewmembers; our being subject to potential unionization, work stoppages, slowdowns or increased labor costs; reputational and business risk from an accident or incident involving our aircraft; risks associated with damage to our reputation and the JetBlue brand name; our significant amount of fixed obligations and the ability to service such obligations; our substantial indebtedness and impact on our ability to meet future financing needs; financial risks associated with credit card processors; risks associated with seeking short-term additional financing liquidity; failure to realize the full value of intangible or long-lived assets, causing us to record impairments; risks associated with disease outbreaks or environmental disasters affecting travel behavior; compliance with environmental laws and regulations, which may cause us to incur substantial costs; the impacts of federal budget constraints or federally imposed furloughs; impact of global climate change and legal, regulatory or market response to such change; increasing attention to, and evolving expectations regarding, environmental, social and governance matters; changes in government regulations in our industry; acts of war or terrorism; and changes in global economic conditions or an economic downturn leading to a continuing or accelerated decrease in demand for air travel. It is routine for our internal projections and expectations to change as the year or each quarter in the year progresses, and therefore it should be clearly understood that the internal projections, beliefs, and assumptions upon which we base our expectations may change prior to the end of each quarter or year.\\n\\nGiven the risks and uncertainties surrounding forward-looking statements, you should not place undue reliance on these statements. You should understand that many important factors, in addition to those discussed or incorporated by reference in this Report, could cause our results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. Further information concerning these and other factors is contained in JetBlue's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the \\\"SEC\\\"), including but not limited to in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 (the \\\"2023 Form 10-K\\\"). In light of these risks and uncertainties, the forward-looking events discussed in this Report might not occur. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this Report. Other than as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.\\n---\\n# Table of Contents\\n\\nWhere You Can Find Other Information\\nOur website is www.jetblue.com.

In our opinion, they reflect all adjustments, including normal recurring items, that are necessary to present fairly the results for interim periods. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\\\"GAAP\\\") have been condensed or omitted as permitted by such rules and regulations; however, we believe that the disclosures included herein are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.\\n\\nWe have reclassified certain prior periods to conform to the current period presentation. Unless otherwise noted, all amounts disclosed are stated before consideration of income taxes.\\n\\nNote 2 - Revenue Recognition\\n\\nThe Company categorizes revenue recognized from contracts with its customers by revenue source as we believe it best depicts the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flow. The following table provides revenue recognized by revenue source for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 (in millions):\\n\\n| |Three Months Ended March 31,|2024|2023|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Passenger revenue|Passenger travel|$1,888|$2,026|\\n| |Loyalty revenue - air transportation|167|156|\\n|Other revenue|Loyalty revenue|107|100|\\n| |Other revenue|47|46|\\n|Total operating revenue| |$2,209|$2,328|\\n\\nTrueBlue® is our customer loyalty program designed to reward and recognize our customers. TrueBlue® points earned from ticket purchases are recorded as a reduction to Passenger travel within passenger revenue. Amounts presented in Loyalty revenue - air transportation represent revenue recognized when TrueBlue® points have been redeemed and travel has occurred. Loyalty revenue within other revenue is primarily comprised of the non-air transportation elements from the sale of TrueBlue® points.\\n\\nContract Liabilities\\n\\nOur contract liabilities primarily consist of ticket sales for which transportation has not yet been provided, unused credits available to customers, and outstanding loyalty points available for redemption (in millions):\\n---\\n# March 31, 2024\\n\\n# December 31, 2023\\n\\n| |Air traffic liability - passenger travel|Air traffic liability - loyalty program (air transportation)|\\n|---|---|---|\\n| |$1,354|$1,076|\\n|Deferred revenue (1)|472|487|\\n|Total|$2,902|$2,658|\\n\\n(1) Deferred revenue is included within other accrued liabilities and other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.\\n\\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, we recognized passenger revenue of $834 million and $858 million, respectively, which was included in passenger travel liability at the beginning of the respective periods.\\n\\nThe Company elected the practical expedient that allows entities to not disclose the amount of the remaining transaction price and its expected timing of recognition for passenger tickets if the contract has an original expected duration of one year or less or if certain other conditions are met. We elected to apply this practical expedient to our contract liabilities relating to passenger travel and ancillary services as our tickets or any related passenger credits expire generally one year from the date of booking.\\n\\nTrueBlue® points are combined into one homogeneous pool and are not separately identifiable. As such, the revenue is comprised of points that were part of the air traffic liability balance at the beginning of the period as well as points that were issued during the period.\\n\\nThe table below presents the activity of the current and non-current air traffic liability for our loyalty program, and includes points earned and sold to participating companies for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 (in millions):\\n\\n| |Balance at December 31, 2023|\\n|---|---|\\n|TrueBlue® points redeemed passenger|(160)|\\n|TrueBlue® points redeemed other|(7)|\\n|TrueBlue® points earned and sold|171|\\n|Balance at March 31, 2024|$1,076|\\n\\n| |Balance at December 31, 2022|\\n|---|---|\\n|TrueBlue® points redeemed passenger|(156)|\\n|TrueBlue® points redeemed other| |\\n|TrueBlue® points earned and sold|154|\\n|Balance at March 31, 2023|$998|\\n\\nThe timing of our TrueBlue® point redemptions can vary; however, the majority of points are redeemed within approximately three years of the date of issuance.\\n\\nNote 3 - Long-term Debt, Short-term Borrowings and Finance Lease Obligations\\n\\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2024, we made principal payments of $58 million on our outstanding debt and finance lease obligations.\\n---\\n# At March 31, 2024, we had pledged aircraft, engines, other equipment, and facilities with a net book value of $6.4 billion as security under various financing arrangements.\\n\\n|Year|Total|\\n|---|---|\\n|Remainder of 2024|$265|\\n|2025|$302|\\n|2026|$1,044|\\n|2027|$297|\\n|2028|$403|\\n|Thereafter|$2,701|\\n|Total|$5,012|\\n\\nThe carrying amounts and estimated fair values of our long-term debt, net of debt acquisition costs, at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were as follows (in millions):\\n\\n| |March 31, 2024|December 31, 2023|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Public Debt|Carrying Value|Estimated Fair Value (1)|Carrying Value|Estimated Fair Value|\\n|Fixed rate special facility bonds, due through 2036|$42|$43|$42|$43|\\n|Fixed rate enhanced equipment notes:| | | | |\\n|2019-1 Series AA, due through 2032|$477|$483|$476|$474|\\n|2019-1 Series A, due through 2028|$149|$151|$149|$150|\\n|2019-1 Series B, due through 2027|$70|$86|$70|$86|\\n|2020-1 Series A, due through 2032|$506|$606|$506|$597|\\n|2020-1 Series B, due through 2028|$117|$150|$117|$150|\\n|Non-Public Debt| | | | |\\n|Fixed rate equipment notes, due through 2028|$290|$278|$322|$305|\\n|Floating rate equipment notes, due through 2030 (2)|$101|$106|$109|$113|\\n---\\nAircraft sale-leaseback transactions, due through 2036\\n\\n| |1,962|2,121|1,648|1,738|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| | | | | |\\n\\nUnsecured CARES Act Payroll Support Program loan, due through 2030\\n\\n| |259|190|259|184|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| | | | | |\\n\\nUnsecured Consolidated Appropriations Act Payroll Support Program Extension loan, due through 2031\\n\\n| |144|104|144|101|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| | | | | |\\n\\nUnsecured American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 Payroll Support loan, due through 2031\\n\\n| |132|96|132|93|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| | | | | |\\n\\n0.50% convertible senior notes due through 2026\\n\\n| |743|671|742|657|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| | | | | |\\n\\nTotal (3) $ 4,992 $ 5,085 $ 4,716 $ 4,691\\n\\n(1) The estimated fair values of our publicly held long-term debt are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair values of our non-public debt are estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on our borrowing rates for instruments with similar terms and therefore classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair values of our other financial instruments approximate their carrying values. Refer to Note 7 for an explanation of the fair value hierarchy structure.\\n\\n(2) Floating rate debt is equal to Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\\\"SOFR\\\"), plus a margin.\\n\\n(3) Total excludes finance lease obligations of $20 million at March 31, 2024 and an immaterial amount at December 31, 2023.\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nPART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION\\n\\nITEM 1. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JETBLUE AIRWAYS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)\\n\\nWe have financed certain aircraft with Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificates (\\\"EETCs\\\"). One of the benefits of this structure is being able to finance several aircraft at one time, rather than individually. The structure of EETC financing is that we create pass-through trusts in order to issue pass-through certificates. The proceeds from the issuance of these certificates are then used to purchase equipment notes which are issued by us and are secured by our aircraft. These trusts meet the definition of a variable interest entity (\\\"VIE\\\"), as defined in Topic 810, Consolidation of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\\\"FASB\\\") Codification, and must be considered for consolidation in our financial statements. Our assessment of our EETCs considers both quantitative and qualitative factors including the purpose for which these trusts were established and the nature of the risks in each. The main purpose of the trust structure is to enhance the creditworthiness of our debt obligation through certain bankruptcy protection provisions and liquidity facilities, and also to lower our total borrowing cost. We concluded that we are not the primary beneficiary in these trusts because our involvement in them is limited to principal and interest payments on the related notes, the trusts were not set up to pass along variability created by credit risk to us, and the likelihood of our defaulting on the notes. Therefore, we have not consolidated these trusts in our financial statements.\\n\\n2024 Sale-Leaseback Transactions\\n\\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2024, we entered into $332 million of sale-leaseback transactions. These transactions did not qualify as sales for accounting purposes. The assets associated with these transactions remain on our consolidated balance sheets within property and equipment and the related liabilities under the lease\\n---\\nare classified within debt and finance leases obligations. These transactions are treated as cash from financing activities on our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.\\n\\nShort-term Borrowings\\n\\nCitibank Line of Credit\\nOn October 21, 2022, JetBlue entered into pe $600 million Second Amended and Restated Credit and Guaranty Agreement (pe \\\"Facility\\\"), among JetBlue, Citibank N.A., as administrative agent, and pe lenders party pereto. Borrowings under pe Facility bear interest at a variable rate based on SOFR, plus a margin of 2.00% per annum, or anoper rate (at JetBlue's election) based on certain market interest rates, plus a margin of 1.00% per annum, in each case wip a floor of 0%. The Facility is secured by spare parts, aircraft, simulators, and certain oper assets as permitted pereunder. The Facility includes covenants pat require us to maintain certain minimum balances in unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, and unused commitments available under revolving credit facilities. In addition, pe covenants restrict our ability to, among oper pings, dispose of certain collateral, or merge, consolidate, or sell assets. On October 17, 2023, JetBlue furper amended pe Facility to, among oper pings, extend pe maturity date to October 21, 2025.\\nAs of and for pe periods ended March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we did not have a balance outstanding or any borrowings under pe Facility.\\n\\nMorgan Stanley Line of Credit\\nWe have a revolving line of credit wip Morgan Stanley for up to approximately $200 million. This line of credit is secured by a portion of our investment securities held by Morgan Stanley and pe amount available to us under pis line of credit may vary accordingly. This line of credit bears interest at a floating rate based upon LIBOR (or such replacement index as pe bank shall determine from time to time in accordance wip pe terms of pe agreement), plus a margin. As of and for pe periods ended March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we did not have a balance outstanding or any borrowings under pis line of credit.\\n\\n2022 $3.5 Billion Senior Secured Bridge Facility\\nJetBlue entered into a Second Amended and Restated Commitment Letter (pe \\\"Commitment Letter\\\"), dated July 28, 2022, wip Goldman Sachs Bank USA; BofA Securities, Inc.; Bank of America, N.A.; BNP Paribas; Credit Suisse AG, New York Branch; Credit Suisse Loan Funding LLC; Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank; Natixis, New York Branch; Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation; and MUFG Bank, Lp. (collectively, pe \\\"Commitment Parties\\\"), pursuant to which pe Commitment Parties committed to provide a senior secured bridge facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $3.5 billion to finance pe acquisition of Spirit Airlines, Inc. (\\\"Spirit\\\") under pe Agreement and Plan of Merger (pe \\\"Merger Agreement\\\"). The Commitment Letter was terminated on March 4, 2024. Prior to its termination, we did not have a balance outstanding or any borrowings under pis facility. Please refer to Note 12 for additional details on pe termination of pe Merger Agreement.\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nPART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION\\n\\nITEM 1. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JETBLUE AIRWAYS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)\\n\\nNote 4 - Loss Per Share\\n\\nBasic loss per share is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares outstanding. Diluted loss per share is calculated similarly but includes potential dilution from restricted stock units, the crewmember stock purchase plan, convertible notes, warrants issued under various federal payroll support programs, and any other potentially dilutive instruments using the treasury stock and if-converted method. Anti-dilutive common stock equivalents excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share amounts were 3.8 million and 1.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and March 31, 2023, respectively.\\n---\\n# The following table shows how we computed basic and diluted loss per common share for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 (dollars and share data in millions):\\n\\n| |Three Months Ended March 31, 2024|Three Months Ended March 31, 2023|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Net loss|$ (716)|$ (192)|\\n|Weighted average basic shares|339.7|327.6|\\n|Effect of dilutive securities|-|-|\\n|Weighted average diluted shares|$ 339.7|327.6|\\n|Loss per common share| | |\\n|Basic|$ (2.11)|$ (0.58)|\\n|Diluted|$ (2.11)|$ (0.58)|\\n\\nNote 5 - Crewmember Retirement Plan\\n\\nWe sponsor a retirement savings 401(k) defined contribution plan (the \\\"Plan\\\"), covering our U.S. and Puerto Rico crewmembers, where we match 100% of our eligible crewmember's contributions up to 5% of their eligible wages. Employer contributions vest after three years of service and are measured from a crewmember's hire date. Crewmembers are vested immediately in their voluntary contributions.\\n\\nCertain Federal Aviation Administration (\\\"FAA\\\") licensed crewmembers received a discretionary contribution of 3% of eligible compensation, which we refer to as Retirement Advantage. As of January 2024, the Retirement Advantage program ended and these licensed Crewmembers now receive a discretionary contribution of 8% of eligible compensation, which we refer to as Retirement Non-elective Licensed Crewmember contributions. System Controllers also receive a Company discretionary contribution of 5% of eligible compensation, referred to as Retirement Non-elective Crewmember contributions. The Company’s non-elective contributions vest after three years of service.\\n\\nOur Pilots receive a non-elective Company contribution of 16% of eligible compensation per the terms of the finalized collective bargaining agreement between JetBlue and the Air Line Pilots Association (\\\"ALPA\\\"), in lieu of the above 401(k) Company matching contribution, Retirement Non-elective, and Retirement Advantage contributions.

Our agreements with these processors do not contain covenants, but do generally allow the processor to withhold cash reserves to protect the processor from potential liability for tickets purchased, but not yet used for travel. While we currently do not have any collateral requirements related to our credit card processors, we may be required to issue collateral to our credit card processors, or other key business partners, in the future.\\n\\nAs of March 31, 2024, we had $59 million in restricted cash assets serving as collateral for letters of credit relating to a certain number of our leases, which will expire at the end of the related lease terms. We also had a $65 million letter of credit relating to our 5% ownership in JFK Millennium Partner LLC, a private entity that will finance, develop, and operate John F. Kennedy International Airport (\\\"JFK\\\") Terminal 6. The letters of credit are included in restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, we had $32 million cash pledged primarily related to our workers' compensation insurance policies and other business partner agreements, which will expire according to the terms of the related policies or agreements.\\n---\\n# Table of Contents\\n\\n# PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION\\n\\n# ITEM 1. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JETBLUE AIRWAYS CORPORATION\\n\\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)\\n\\n# Labor Unions and Non-Unionized Crewmembers\\n\\nAs of March 31, 2024, 52% of our full-time equivalent crewmembers were represented by labor unions. The pilot group, which represents 22% of our full-time equivalent crewmembers, is covered by a collective bargaining agreement that have begun initial negotiations in April 2024. Our pilots are represented by ALPA. Our inflight crewmembers and flight instructors are represented by the Transport Workers Union of America (\\\"TWU\\\"); our other frontline crewmembers do not have third party representation.\\n\\nALPA In January 2023, JetBlue pilots approved a two-year contract extension effective March 1, 2023, which included a ratification payment and adjustments to paid-time-off accruals resulting from pay rate increases of $95 million. This was recorded as an expense within special items in the first quarter of 2023.\\n\\nTWU On July 14, 2022, TWU filed a representation application with the National Mediation Board (\\\"NMB\\\") seeking an election among the 35 pilot instructors (called \\\"Flight Instructors\\\"). JetBlue disputed TWU’s application alleging that \\\"Flight Instructors\\\" do not constitute a craft or class. On October 26, 2023, the NMB notified the participants that it rejected JetBlue’s argument and ordered an election. The Flight Instructors voted for TWU representation. Contract negotiations have not yet begun.\\n\\n# Non-Unionized Crewmembers\\n\\nWe enter into individual employment agreements with each of our non-unionized FAA-licensed crewmembers, which include dispatchers, technicians, inspectors, and air traffic controllers. Each employment agreement is for a term of five years and automatically renews for an additional five years unless either the crewmember or we elect not to renew it by giving at least 90 days' notice before the end of the relevant term. Pursuant to these agreements, these crewmembers can only be terminated for cause. In the event of a downturn in our business that would require a reduction in work hours, we are obligated to pay these crewmembers a guaranteed level of income and to continue their benefits if they do not obtain other aviation employment.\\n\\n# Legal Matters\\n\\nOccasionally, we are involved in various claims, lawsuits, regulatory examinations, investigations, and other legal matters involving suppliers, crewmembers, customers, and governmental agencies, arising, for the most part, in the ordinary course of business. The outcome of litigation and other legal matters is always uncertain. The Company believes it has valid defenses to the legal matters currently pending against it, is defending itself vigorously, and has recorded accruals determined in accordance with GAAP, where appropriate. In making a determination regarding accruals, using available information, we evaluate the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome in legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party and record a loss contingency when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These subjective determinations are based on the status of such legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses, and consultation with legal counsel. Actual outcomes of these legal and regulatory proceedings may materially differ from our current estimates. It is possible that resolution of one or more of the legal matters currently pending or threatened could result in losses material to our condensed consolidated results of operations, liquidity, or financial condition.\\n\\nTo date, none of these types of litigation matters, most of which are typically covered by insurance, has had a material impact on our operations or financial condition. We have insured and continue to insure against most of\\n---\\n# these types of claims. A judgment on any claim not covered by, or in excess of, our insurance coverage could materially adversely affect our condensed consolidated results of operations, liquidity, or financial condition.\\n\\nAs previously disclosed, in July 2020, JetBlue and American Airlines Group Inc. (\\\"American\\\") entered into the Northeast Alliance (the \\\"NEA\\\"), which was designed to optimize our respective networks at JFK Airport, LaGuardia Airport, Newark Liberty International Airport, and Boston Logan International Airport. On September 21, 2021, the United States Department of Justice, along with the Attorneys General of six states and the District of Columbia filed suit against JetBlue and American seeking to enjoin the NEA, alleging that it violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act. The court issued a decision on May 19, 2023, permanently enjoining the NEA, and shortly thereafter we initiated a wind down of the NEA. On July 28, 2023, the court issued its Final Judgement and Order Entering Permanent Injunction, which took effect on August 18, 2023 (the \\\"Final Injunction\\\"). The wind down of the NEA is substantially complete, but remaining impacts could require us to incur additional costs and therefore have an impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\\n\\n# Table of Contents\\n\\n# PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION\\n\\n# ITEM 1. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\n# JETBLUE AIRWAYS CORPORATION\\n\\n# NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\n\\n# (unaudited)\\n\\nIn December 2022 and February 2023, four putative class actions lawsuits were filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York and the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, respectively, alleging that the NEA violates Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. Among other things, plaintiffs seek monetary damages on behalf of a putative class of direct purchasers of airline tickets from JetBlue and American and, depending on the specific case, other airlines on flights to or from NEA airports from July 16, 2020 through the present. Plaintiffs in these actions also seek to enjoin the NEA. JetBlue believes these lawsuits are without merit and has moved to dismiss the claims.\\n\\nFor information on legal proceedings related to our previously planned acquisition of Spirit, see Note 12.\\n\\nNote 7 - Fair Value\\n\\nUnder Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, (the \\\"Codification\\\"), disclosures are required about how fair value is determined for assets and liabilities and a hierarchy for which these assets and liabilities must be grouped is established, based on significant levels of inputs as follows:\\n\\n- Level 1 - observable inputs such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\\n- Level 2 - quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, and other inputs that are observable directly or indirectly for the asset or liability; or\\n- Level 3 - unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, such as discounted cash flow models or valuations.\\n\\nThe determination of where assets and liabilities fall within this hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\\n\\nThe following is a listing of our assets required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis and where they are classified within the fair value hierarchy as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in millions):\\n\\n| |March 31, 2024|\\n|---|---|\\n|Assets| |Level 1|Level 2|Level 3|Total|\\n|Cash equivalents|$897| | | |$897|\\n---\\n# Available-for-sale investment securities\\n\\n240\\n16\\n256\\n\\n# Aircraft fuel derivatives\\n\\n4\\n\\n4\\n\\nDecember 31, 2023\\n\\n| |Level 1|Level 2|Level 3|Total|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Cash equivalents|$724|$—|$—|$724|\\n|Available-for-sale investment securities| |314|16|330|\\n|Aircraft fuel derivatives| |4| |4|\\n\\nRefer to Note 3 for fair value information related to our outstanding debt obligations as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\\n\\n# Cash Equivalents\\n\\nOur cash equivalents include money market securities and time deposits which are readily convertible into cash, have maturities of three months or less when purchased, and are considered to be highly liquid and easily tradable. The money market securities are valued using inputs observable in active markets for identical securities and are therefore classified as Level 1 within our fair value hierarchy and recorded within cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheets.\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nPART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION\\n\\nITEM 1. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JETBLUE AIRWAYS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)\\n\\n# Available-for-Sale Investment Securities\\n\\nOur available-for-sale investment securities include investments such as time deposits, commercial paper, and convertible debt securities. The fair value of time deposits and commercial paper is based on observable inputs in non-active markets, which are therefore classified as Level 2 in the hierarchy. The fair value of convertible debt securities is based on unobservable inputs and is classified as Level 3 in the hierarchy.\\n\\n# Aircraft Fuel Derivatives\\n\\nOur aircraft fuel derivatives include call spread options which are not traded on public exchanges. Their fair values are determined using a market approach based on inputs that are readily available from public markets for commodities and energy trading activities; therefore, they are classified as Level 2 inputs. The data inputs are combined into qualitative models and processes to generate forward curves and volatility related to the specific terms of the underlying hedge contracts. Aircraft fuel derivatives are included in prepaid expenses and other within current assets of our consolidated balance sheets.\\n\\n# Held-to-Maturity Investment Securities\\n\\nOur held-to-maturity investment securities consist of corporate bonds, which are stated at amortized cost. If the corporate bonds were measured at fair value, they would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy, based on quoted prices in active markets for similar securities.\\n\\nWe do not intend to sell these investment securities. The carrying value and estimated fair value of our held-to-maturity investment securities were as follows (in millions):\\n---\\n# March 31, 2024\\n\\n# December 31, 2023\\n\\n| |Carrying Value|Fair Value|Carrying Value|Fair Value|\\n|---|---|---|---|---|\\n|Held-to-maturity investment securities|$215|$212|$234|$231|\\n\\nNote 8 - Investments\\n\\nInvestments in Debt Securities\\n\\nInvestments in debt securities consist of available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investment securities. The carrying amount is recorded within investment securities in the current assets section of our consolidated balance sheets if the remaining maturity is less than twelve months. Maturities greater than twelve months are recorded within investment securities in the other assets section of our consolidated balance sheets. The aggregate carrying values of our short-term and long-term debt investment securities consisted of the following at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in millions):\\n\\n| |March 31, 2024|December 31, 2023|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Available-for-sale investment securities| | |\\n|Time deposits|$215|$290|\\n|Commercial paper|$25|$24|\\n|Debt securities|$16|$16|\\n|Total available-for-sale investment securities|$256|$330|\\n\\n|Held-to-maturity investment securities| | |\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Corporate bonds|$215|$234|\\n|Total held-to-maturity investment securities|$215|$234|\\n\\nTotal investments in debt securities: $471 (March 31, 2024) and $564 (December 31, 2023).\\n\\nWhen sold, we use a specific identification method to determine the cost of the securities. Refer to Note 7 for an explanation of the fair value hierarchy structure.\\n\\nWe did not record any material gains or losses on available-for-sale or held-to-maturity investment securities during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.\\n\\n# Equity Investments\\n\\nThe aggregate carrying values of our equity investments are recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets and consist of the following at March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023 (in millions):\\n\\nMarch 31, 2024\\nDecember 31, 2023\\n---\\n# Equity method investments\\n\\n| |March 31, 2024|March 31, 2023|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|JetBlue Ventures equity investments|$79|$96|\\n|TWA Flight Center|$14|$14|\\n|Total equity investments|$140|$153|\\n\\n(1) We have the ability to exercise significant influence over these investments and therefore they are accounted for using the equity method in accordance with Topic 323, Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures of the FASB Codification. Our share of our equity method investees’ financial results is included in other income on our consolidated statement of operations. We did not record any material gains or losses on our equity method investment securities during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.\\n\\n(2) Our wholly owned subsidiary JetBlue Technology Ventures LLC (\\\"JBV\\\") has equity investments are in emerging companies which do not have readily determinable fair values. In accordance with Topic 321, Investments - Equity Securities of the FASB Codification, we account for these investments using a measurement alternative which allows entities to measure these investments at cost, less any impairment, adjusted for changes from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identifiable or similar investments of the same issuer. Refer to the table below for investment gain (loss) activity during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.\\n\\n(3) We have an approximate 10% ownership interest in the TWA Flight Center Hotel at JFK, which is accounted for under the measurement alternative described above. We did not record any material gains or losses on our TWA Flight Center Hotel during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023.\\n\\n(4) As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, we had an immaterial amount of equity securities recorded within investment securities in the current asset section of our consolidated balance sheets. Our equity securities include investments in common stocks of publicly traded companies which are stated at fair value. Refer to the table below for investment gain (loss) activity during the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 (in millions):\\n\\n# JBV Equity Investments\\n\\n| |March 31, 2024|March 31, 2023|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Unrealized loss recognized in gain (loss) on investments, net (1)|$(22)|$—|\\n\\n# Equity Securities\\n\\n| |March 31, 2024|March 31, 2023|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Unrealized gain recognized in gain (loss) on investments, net|$—|$3|\\n\\n(1) The net unrealized loss primarily relates to a mark-to-market adjustment on our preferred shares of one of our JBV equity investments.\\n\\nNote 9 - Financial Derivative Instruments and Risk Management\\n\\nAs part of our risk management techniques, we periodically purchase over the counter energy derivative instruments to manage our exposure to the effect of changes in the price of aircraft fuel. Prices for the underlying commodities have historically been highly correlated to aircraft fuel, making derivatives of them effective at providing short-term protection against sharp increases in average fuel prices. We do not hold or issue any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.\\n---\\n# Aircraft Fuel Derivatives\\n\\nWe attempt to obtain cash flow hedge accounting treatment for each fuel derivative that we enter into. This treatment is provided for under the Derivatives and Hedging topic of the FASB Codification which allows for gains and losses on the effective portion of qualifying hedges to be deferred until the underlying planned aircraft fuel consumption occurs, rather than recognizing the gains and losses on these instruments into earnings during each period they are outstanding.\\n\\nFor the effective portion of hedges, when aircraft fuel is consumed and the related derivative contract settles, any gain or loss previously recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) is recognized in aircraft fuel expense. All cash flows related to our fuel hedging derivatives are classified as operating cash flows.\\n\\nIneffectiveness occurs, in certain circumstances, when the change in the total fair value of the derivative instrument differs from the change in the value of our expected future cash outlays for the purchase of aircraft fuel. If a hedge does not qualify for hedge accounting, the periodic changes in its fair value are recognized in interest income and other.\\n\\nOur current approach to fuel hedging is to enter into hedges on a discretionary basis. We view our hedge portfolio as a form of insurance to help mitigate the impact of price volatility and protect us against severe spikes in oil prices, when possible.\\n\\n**Approximate hedged percentages of projected fuel usage by quarter as of March 31, 2024**\\n|Aircraft fuel call option spread agreements|Percentage|\\n|---|---|\\n|Second quarter 2024|27%|\\n|Third quarter 2024|3%|\\n|Fourth quarter 2024|5%|\\n\\n**Quantitative information related to derivative instruments**\\n| |March 31, 2024|December 31, 2023|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Fuel derivatives|$4|$4|\\n|Longest remaining term (months)|3|3|\\n|Hedged volume (barrels, in thousands)|1,827|2,706|\\n|Estimated amount of existing gains (losses) expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next 12 months|$—|$(3)|\\n\\n**Three Months Ended March 31**\\n|Fuel derivatives|2024|2023|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Hedge effectiveness gains (losses) recognized in aircraft fuel expense|$(2)|$1|\\n---\\n# Hedge gains (losses) on derivatives recognized in comprehensive income\\n\\n| | | |\\n|---|---|---|\\n| |$|$|\\n| |1|(5)|\\n\\nPercentage of actual consumption economically hedged: 30% 9%\\n\\nAny outstanding derivative instrument exposes us to credit loss in connection with our fuel contracts in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to our agreements; however, we do not expect that any of our counterparties will fail to meet their obligations. The amount of such credit exposure is generally the fair value of our outstanding contracts for which we are in a receivable position.\\n\\nTo manage credit risks we select counterparties based on credit assessments, limit our overall exposure to any single counterparty, and monitor the market position with each counterparty. Some of our agreements require cash deposits from either JetBlue or our counterparty if market risk exposure exceeds a specified threshold amount.\\n\\nWe have master netting arrangements with our counterparties allowing us the right of offset to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions. The financial derivative instrument agreements we have with our counterparties may require us to fund all, or a portion of, outstanding loss positions related to these contracts prior to their scheduled maturities. The amount of collateral posted, if any, is periodically adjusted based on the fair value of the hedge contracts. Our policy is to offset the liabilities represented by these contracts with any cash collateral paid to the counterparties.\\n\\nThere were no offsetting derivative instruments as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023.\\n\\n# Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\\n\\nNote 10 - Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\\n\\nComprehensive income (loss) includes changes in fair value of our aircraft fuel derivatives which qualify for hedge accounting and unrealized gain (loss) on available-for-sale securities. A rollforward of the amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 is as follows (in millions):\\n\\n| |Aircraft fuel derivatives (1)|Available-for-sale securities|Total|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Balance of accumulated loss, at December 31, 2023|$(3)|$(1)|$(4)|\\n|Reclassifications into earnings, net of taxes of $0|2|—|2|\\n|Change in fair value, net of taxes of $0|1|—|1|\\n|Balance of accumulated gain (loss), at March 31, 2024|—|$(1)|$(1)|\\n|Balance of accumulated income (loss), at December 31, 2022|$1|$(1)|—|\\n|Reclassifications into earnings, net of taxes $0|$(1)|—|$(1)|\\n|Change in fair value, net of taxes of $(1)|$(4)|—|$(4)|\\n---\\n# Balance of accumulated loss, at March 31, 2023\\n\\n| |2023|2024|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Reclassified to aircraft fuel expense|($1)|($4)|($5)|\\n\\n# Note 11 - Special Items\\n\\nThe following is a listing of special items presented on our consolidated statements of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023 (in millions):\\n\\n|Special items|2024|2023|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Spirit-related costs (1)|$532|$17|\\n|Voluntary opt-out costs (2)|$15|$—|\\n|Embraer E190 fleet transition costs (3)|$15|$—|\\n|Union contract costs (4)|$—|$95|\\n|Total special items|$562|$112|\\n\\n(1) As a result of the termination of the Merger Agreement in the first quarter of 2024, we wrote off the Spirit prepayment and breakup fee discussed in Note 12. These costs also include consulting, professional, and legal fees. Spirit costs in the first quarter of 2023 primarily relate to consulting, professional and legal fees.\\n\\n(2) Voluntary opt-out costs relate to severance and benefit costs associated with the Company's opt-out program for eligible crewmembers in the airports, customer support, JetBlue Travel Products and support center workgroups.\\n\\n(3) Embraer E190 fleet transition costs relate to the early termination of a flight-hour engine services agreement.\\n\\n(4) Union contract costs primarily relate to pilot ratification payments and adjustments to paid-time-off accruals resulting from pay rate increases. See Note 6 for further discussion.\\n\\n# Note 12 - Termination of Merger Agreement with Spirit\\n\\nThe Merger Agreement\\n\\nAs previously disclosed, on July 28, 2022, JetBlue entered into the Merger Agreement with Spirit and Sundown Acquisition Corp., formerly a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of JetBlue (\\\"Merger Sub\\\"), pursuant to which and subject to the terms and conditions therein, Merger Sub would merge with and into Spirit, with Spirit continuing as the surviving corporation (the \\\"Merger\\\").\\n---\\n# On March 1, 2024, JetBlue, Spirit and Merger Sub Termination Agreement\\n\\nOn March 1, 2024, JetBlue, Spirit and Merger Sub entered into a Termination Agreement (the \\\"Termination Agreement\\\"), pursuant to which the parties agreed to terminate the Merger Agreement, effective immediately, subject to limited exceptions related to JetBlue’s previously agreed indemnification obligations. Pursuant to the Termination Agreement, JetBlue agreed to pay the $69 million breakup fee on March 5, 2024, which was recorded in special items on the consolidated statement of operations. The parties also agreed to release each other from claims, demands, damages, actions, causes of action and liability relating to or arising out of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated therein or thereby.\\n\\n# Monthly Prepayments and Additional Prepayment Amount\\n\\nIn accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, on a monthly basis between January 2023 and February 2024, JetBlue paid to the holders of record of outstanding Spirit shares an amount in cash equal to $0.10 per Spirit share (such amount, the \\\"Additional Prepayment Amount\\\", and each such monthly payment, an \\\"Additional Prepayment\\\"). During the quarter ended March 31, 2024, JetBlue made an aggregate of $22 million in Additional Prepayments to Spirit shareholders resulting in a total prepayment of $425 million. These Additional Prepayments have been written off, in addition to the $25 million reimbursement payment to Spirit in connection with the Frontier transaction costs as a result of the termination of the Merger Agreement. The write off is recorded in special items on the consolidated statement of operations for the period ending March 31, 2024.\\n\\n# Valuation Allowance and Tax Impact\\n\\nIn the first quarter of 2024, the Company recorded a valuation allowance of $134 million related to the tax impact of the Spirit transaction costs.\\n\\n# Senior Secured Bridge Facility Commitment\\n\\nRefer to Note 3 for further detail of the $3.5 billion Senior Secured Bridge Facility commitment to fund the purchase of Spirit, which was terminated concurrently with the termination of the Merger Agreement.\\n\\n# Legal Proceedings Related to the Merger\\n\\nAs previously disclosed, legal proceedings were initiated related to the Merger. The U.S. Department of Justice, along with the Attorneys General of six states and the District of Columbia, filed suit against JetBlue and Spirit seeking a permanent injunction preventing the Merger. The trial concluded with a permanent injunction of the Merger. Additionally, individual consumers filed suit seeking to enjoin the Merger, which was transferred to a different district court. Following the Termination Agreement, motions to dismiss all proceedings related to the Private Merger Lawsuit were made in various courts.\\n\\n# Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\\n\\nPart I, Item 2 of this Report should be read together with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Report and our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our 2023 Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current plans, expectations and beliefs involving risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth in Part I, Item 1A \\\"Risk Factors\\\" of our 2023 Form 10-K and in Part II, Item 1A \\\"Risk Factors\\\" and other parts of this Report.\\n---\\n# OVERVIEW\\n\\nFirst Quarter 2024 Results\\n\\nIn the first quarter of 2024, we experienced improved operational reliability and healthy peak demand. Despite industry cost pressures, we continue to execute on our controllable cost initiatives.\\n\\nOur first quarter highlights include as follows:\\n\\n- First quarter 2024 system capacity decreased by 2.7% compared to the first quarter of 2023.\\n- Revenue for the first quarter of 2024 decreased by $119 million year-over-year to $2.2 billion, a 5.1% decrease compared to the first quarter of 2023.\\n- Operating expense for the first quarter of 2024 increased by 14.0% year-over-year to $2.9 billion.\\n- Operating expense, excluding special items for the first quarter of 2024 decreased 3.7% year-over-year.\\n- Operating expense per available seat mile (\\\"CASM\\\") for the first quarter of 2024 increased by 17.1% year-over-year to 17.95 cents compared to the first quarter of 2023.\\n- Our operating expense for the first quarter of 2024 and 2023 included the effects of special items. Excluding aircraft fuel, special items, and operating expenses related to our non-airline businesses, our operating expense increased by 4.2% to $1.7 billion year-over-year.\\n- Excluding fuel, special items, and operating expenses related to our non-airline businesses, our cost per available seat mile (\\\"CASM ex-fuel\\\") increased by 7.1% to 10.57 cents in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the first quarter of 2023.\\n- For the first quarter of 2024 and 2023, our reported loss per share was $2.11 and $0.58, respectively. Excluding special items, our adjusted loss per share for the first quarter of 2024 and 2023 was $0.43 and $0.34, respectively.\\n\\nRecent Developments\\n\\nNetworkDuring the quarter, we expanded our presence in the transatlantic market with new seasonal service to Dublin, Ireland from New York and Boston, and launched daily nonstop service to Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport from Boston. We also began service to Tallahassee, Florida.\\n\\nWe announced we will be moving a number of routes and markets from daily service to seasonal service to free up aircraft for increased frequency and relevance in markets that are more profitable. We have actioned to leave Baltimore, Maryland; Bogota, Colombia; Burlington, Vermont; Kansas City, Missouri; Lima, Peru; Newburgh, New York; and Quito, Ecuador, to better utilize our aircraft in other markets.\\n\\nCustomer Experience\\n\\nWe announced new and improved signature perks for Mosaic program members, including dedicated phone support, greater access to the Mint cabin, and the ability to gift Mosaic 1 status, further expanding the ways our most loyal customers can be awarded.\\n\\nWe announced new Mint® product offerings expected to launch in Spring 2024, including new amenity partners, menu changes and entertainment options.\\n\\nWe launched preferred seating on select routes, giving customers more options to choose the seat that best aligns with their preferences.\\n\\n(1) Refer to \\\"Regulation G Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\\\" at the end of this section for more information on this non-GAAP measure.\\n\\n# Table of Contents\\n\\nPART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION\\n\\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\\n---\\n# Pratt & Whitney\\n\\nIn July 2023, Pratt & Whitney, a division of Raytheon Technologies, announced the requirement, mandated by the Federal Aviation Administration (\\\"FAA\\\"), for removal of certain engines for inspection due to contaminated powdered metal used in high-pressure turbine disks on the V2500, PW1100G, and PW1500G engine types. These engines power our Airbus A320, Airbus A220 and Airbus A321neo fleets. The contaminated powdered metal affects engines manufactured between October 2015 and September 2021. Engines are now required to be inspected after they have reached a reduced number of cycles dependent on the fleet type. As of March 31, 2024, we had nine aircraft grounded for required inspection. The Company currently expects each removed engine to take up to 360 days to complete a shop visit and return to a serviceable condition and expects an average of 11 aircraft out of service throughout the year.\\n\\nIn 2023, we reached a confidential settlement agreement with Pratt & Whitney, which was intended to address damages incurred by us in 2023 due to the grounding of the affected engines. Into 2024 and beyond, we expect to have a certain number of engines grounded and, therefore, will continue to assess the resulting impact on our future capacity plans. We are currently working with Pratt & Whitney on compensation arrangements.\\n\\nWhile we are working with Pratt & Whitney to secure additional compensation, the full impact of the removal and any potential remediation steps remains uncertain. The engine groundings, including but not limited to a reduction in capacity, could adversely impact our operations and financial results.\\n\\n# RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\\n\\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2024 vs. 2023\\n\\nOverviewWe reported a net loss of $716 million, operating loss of $719 million and an operating margin of (32.6)% for the three months ended March 31, 2024. This compares to net loss of $192 million, an operating loss of $242 million and an operating margin of (10.4)% for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Our loss per share was $2.11 for the first quarter of 2024 compared to a loss per share of $0.58 for the same period in 2023. Net loss increased $524 million year-over-year primarily due to the write off of Spirit-related costs as a result of the termination of the Merger Agreement discussed in Note 12 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Report.\\n\\nOur reported results for the three months ended March 31, 2024 included the effects of special items. Adjusting for these one-time items, our adjusted net loss (1) was $145 million, adjusted operating loss (1) was $157 million, adjusted operating margin (1) was (7.1)%, and adjusted loss per share (1) was $0.43 for the three months ended March 31, 2024.\\n\\nOur reported results for the three months ended March 31, 2023 included the effects of special items. Adjusting for these one-time items, our adjusted net loss (1) was $111 million, adjusted operating loss (1) was $130 million, adjusted operating margin (1) was (5.6)%, and adjusted loss per share (1) was $0.34 for the three months ended March 31, 2023.\\n\\nOn-time performance, as defined by the DOT, is arrival within 14 minutes of scheduled arrival time. In the first quarter of 2024, our systemwide on-time performance was 70.9% compared to 70.4% for the same period in 2023. Our completion factor decreased to 98.7% in the first quarter of 2024 from 98.8% in the same period in 2023.\\n\\n(1) Refer to \\\"Regulation G Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\\\" at the end of this section for more information on this non-GAAP measure.\\n\\n# Table of Contents\\n\\n# PART I.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Aircraft Fuel Aircraft fuel decreased by $160 million, or 20.4%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Over the same period, the average fuel price decreased by 17.3% to $2.97 per gallon and fuel consumption decreased by 3.8%, or 9 million gallons. Salaries, Wages and Benefits Salaries, wages and benefits increased $82 million, or 11.0%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 driven by wage rate increases. The wage rate increase was primarily due to the new pilot union contract effective March 1, 2023, which included an initial pay rate increase of 14% and an additional 3% pay rate increase effective August 2023. Aircraft Rent Aircraft rent decreased $5 million, or 16.1%, in the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to fewer leases for Airbus A320 aircraft and Embraer E190 aircraft. Maintenance, Materials, and Repairs Maintenance, materials, and repairs decreased $44 million, or 24.2%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due to timing and the type of maintenance events that occurred during the period. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses consist of the following categories: outside services, airport expenses (including expenses related to ground handling, skycap, security, and catering services), personnel expenses, professional and legal fees, onboard supplies, shop and office supplies, bad debts, communication costs and taxes other than payroll and fuel taxes. Other operating expenses increased $22 million, or 6.3%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due in part to information technology service costs, outside services, and personnel expenses. Special Items For the three months ended March 31, 2024, special items included the following: •$532 million relating to Spirit-related costs; •$15 million relating to voluntary opt-out costs; and •$15 million relating to Embraer E190 fleet transition costs.\\n---\\n# For the three months ended March 31, 2023, special items included the following:\\n\\n$95 million relating to union contract costs;\\n$17 million relating to Spirit-related costs.\\n\\n(1) Refer to \\\"Regulation G Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\\\" at the end of this section for more information on this non-GAAP measure.\\n\\n# Table of Contents\\n\\n# PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION\\n\\n# ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\\n\\n# Operational Statistics\\n\\nThe following table sets forth our operating statistics for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023:\\n\\n| |Three Months Ended March 31, 2024|2023|Year-over-Year Change|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Revenue passengers (thousands)|9,584|10,192|(6.0)%|\\n|Revenue passenger miles (RPMs) (millions)|13,002|13,375|(2.8)%|\\n|Available seat miles (ASMs) (millions)|16,313|16,769|(2.7)%|\\n|Load factor|79.7 %|79.8 %|(0.1) pts|\\n|Aircraft utilization (hours per day)|10.2|11.1|(8.1)|\\n|Average fare|$214.39|$214.07|0.1|\\n|Yield per passenger mile (cents)|15.80|16.31|(3.1)|\\n|Passenger revenue per ASM (cents)|12.60|13.01|(3.2)|\\n|Operating revenue per ASM (cents)|13.54|13.88|(2.5)|\\n|Operating expense per ASM (cents)|17.95|15.32|17.1|\\n|Operating expense per ASM, excluding fuel (1) (cents)|10.57|9.87|7.1|\\n|Departures|79,700|87,481|(8.9)|\\n|Average stage length (miles)|1,279|1,199|6.7|\\n|Average number of operating aircraft during period|285|278|2.5|\\n|Average fuel cost per gallon|$2.97|$3.59|(17.3)|\\n|Fuel gallons consumed (millions)|210|219|(3.8)|\\n|Average number of full-time equivalent crewmembers|20,222|20,536|(1.5)|\\n\\nWe expect our operating results to significantly fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter in the future as a result of various factors, many of which are outside of our control. For example, air traffic controller shortages in the\\n---\\nNortheast and Florida continue to cause disruptions in the industry, resulting in the FAA waiving the minimum usage requirement and permitting us to voluntarily turn in up to 10% of our slots in the New York area to help protect our operations. Even with the flight cutbacks, we experienced and continue to expect challenges in the operating environment. Consequently, we believe quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results may not necessarily be meaningful; you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance. Except for uncertainty related to the cost of aircraft fuel, we expect our expenses to continue to increase as we acquire additional aircraft, as our fleet ages, and as we expand the frequency of flights in existing markets as well as enter into new markets.\\n\\nOperational challenges impacted our business in the first quarter of 2024. These challenges include disruptions in our supply chains and those of our business partners, leading to aircraft delivery delays. Additionally, reliability challenges with some of our aircraft engines using new technology have led to grounded aircraft events. These challenges have resulted - and are expected to continue to result - in flight delays and cancellations.\\n\\n# LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\\n\\nThe airline business is capital intensive. Our ability to successfully execute our growth plans is largely dependent on the continued availability of capital on attractive terms. In addition, our ability to successfully operate our business depends on maintaining sufficient liquidity. We believe we have adequate resources from a combination of cash and cash equivalents, investment securities on hand, and available lines of credit. Additionally, our unencumbered assets could be an additional source of liquidity, if necessary.\\n\\nAt March 31, 2024, we had unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and long-term marketable securities of approximately $1.7 billion, which we believe will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months from the date of this Report, and we expect to meet our long-term liquidity needs with our projected cash from operations, available lines of credit and debt financing.\\n\\n(1) Refer to \\\"Regulation G Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\\\" at the end of this section for more information on this non-GAAP measure.\\n\\n# Table of Contents\\n\\n# PART I. FINANCIAL INFORMATION\\n\\n# ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\\n\\nWe believe a healthy liquidity position is a crucial element of our ability to weather any part of the economic cycle while continuing to execute on our plans for profitable growth and increased returns. Our goal is to continue to be diligent with our liquidity, maintain financial flexibility, and be prudent with capital spending.\\n\\n# Analysis of Cash Flows\\n\\nOperating Activities\\n\\nWe rely primarily on operating cash flows to provide working capital for current and future operations. Cash flows from operating activities were $204 million and $405 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease in operating cash flow is driven by the change in working capital and Spirit merger termination.\\n\\nInvesting Activities\\n\\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2024, flight equipment capital expenditures included $386 million related to the purchase of aircraft and spare engines as well as aircraft interior modifications. Flight capital expenditures also included $20 million in spare part purchases. Other property and equipment capital expenditures included ground equipment purchases and facilities improvements for $21 million. Investing activities for the current year period also included $93 million in net proceeds from investment securities, $39 million in pre-delivery deposit payments for future aircraft deliveries and $22 million in Spirit shareholder payments.\\n\\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2023, flight equipment capital expenditures included $131 million related to the purchase of aircraft and spare engines as well as aircraft interior modifications. Flight capital expenditures also included $10 million in spare part purchases.

We have approximately $59 million of restricted cash pledged under standby letters of credit related to certain leases that will expire at the end of the related lease terms. Approximately 61% of our owned property and equipment and intangible assets at net book value were pledged or committed to be pledged as security under various loan agreements.\\n\\nAs of March 31, 2024, our operating fleet consisted of:\\n\\n|Aircraft Type|Aircraft Count|\\n|---|---|\\n|Airbus A220|29|\\n|Airbus A320|11|\\n|Airbus A320 Restyled|119|\\n|Airbus A321|28|\\n|Airbus A321 with Mint®|35|\\n|Airbus A321neo|16|\\n|Airbus A321neo with Mint®|8|\\n|Airbus A321neoLR with Mint®|9|\\n|Embraer E190 (2)|32|\\n|Total|287|\\n\\n(1) This table includes aircraft that have been temporarily removed from service but are expected to return to operation in the future.\\n\\n(2) Embraer E190 excludes 10 permanently parked owned aircraft and 6 parked aircraft awaiting lease return.

Committed expenditures for our aircraft and spare engines include estimated amounts for contractual price escalations and pre-delivery deposits. We expect to meet our pre-delivery deposit requirements for our aircraft by paying cash or by using short-term borrowing facilities for deposits generally required six to 24 months prior to delivery. Any pre-delivery deposits paid by the issuance of notes are fully repaid at the time of delivery of the related aircraft. Depending on market conditions, we anticipate using a mix of cash and debt financing for aircraft scheduled for delivery in 2024. Although we believe debt and/or lease financing should be available to us, we cannot give any assurance that we will be able to secure financing on attractive terms, if at all. To the extent we cannot secure financing on terms we deem attractive, we may be required to pay in cash, further modify our aircraft acquisition plans, or incur higher than anticipated financing costs.\\n\\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements There have been no material changes to off-balance sheet arrangements from the information provided in Item 7.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS REGULATION G RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES We report our financial results in accordance with GAAP; however, we present certain non-GAAP financial measures in this Report. Non-GAAP financial measures are financial measures that are derived from the condensed consolidated financial statements, but that are not presented in accordance with GAAP. We present these non-GAAP financial measures because we believe they provide useful supplemental information that enables a meaningful comparison of our results to others in the airline industry and our prior year results. Investors should consider these non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, our financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Further, our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies. The information below provides an explanation of each non-GAAP financial measure presented in this Report and shows a reconciliation of each such non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Operating Expenses, excluding Fuel, Other Non-Airline Operating Expenses, and Special Items (\\\"Operating Expenses ex-fuel\\\") and Operating Expense ex-fuel per Available Seat Mile ex-fuel (\\\"CASM ex-fuel\\\") Operating Expense per Available Seat Mile (\\\"CASM\\\") is a common metric used in the airline industry. Our CASM for the relevant periods are summarized in the table below. We exclude aircraft fuel, operating expenses related to other non-airline businesses, such as JetBlue Ventures and JetBlue Travel Products, and special items from total operating expenses to determine Operating Expenses ex-fuel, which is a non-GAAP financial measure,\\n---\\n# NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE\\n\\n# RECONCILIATION OF OPERATING EXPENSE AND OPERATING EXPENSE PER ASM (CASM), EXCLUDING FUEL\\n\\n| |Three Months Ended March 31,| | | | |\\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\\n| | | |Cents per ASM| | |\\n|($ in millions; per ASM data in cents; percent changes based on unrounded numbers)|2024|2023|Change|2024|2023|\\n|Total operating expenses|$ 2,928|$ 2,570|14.0|17.95|15.32|\\n|Less:| | | | | |\\n|Aircraft fuel|625|785|(20.4)|3.84|4.68|\\n|Other non-airline expenses|17|18|(4.4)|0.10|0.09|\\n|Special items|562|112|NM (1)|3.44|0.68|\\n|Operating expenses, excluding fuel|$ 1,724|$ 1,655|4.2|10.57|9.87|\\n\\n(1) Not meaningful or greater than 100% change.\\n\\n# Table of Contents\\n\\n# PART I.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk included in our 2023 Form 10-K.\\n\\n# Aircraft Fuel\\n\\nOur results of operations are affected by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel. Market risk is estimated as a hypothetical 10% increase in the March 31, 2024 cost per gallon of fuel. Based on projected fuel consumption for the next 12 months, including the impact of our hedging position, such an increase would result in an increase to aircraft fuel expense of approximately $262 million. As of March 31, 2024, we have hedged approximately 27% of our projected fuel requirement for the second quarter of 2024, 3% for the third quarter of 2024, and 5% for the fourth quarter of 2024.\\n\\n# Interest\\n\\nOur earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on interest expense from variable-rate debt instruments and on interest income generated from our cash and investment balances. The interest rate is fixed for $4.6 billion of our debt and finance lease obligations, with the remaining $395 million having floating interest rates. As of March 31, 2024, if interest rates were on average 100 basis points higher year-over-year, our annual interest expense would increase by approximately $4 million. This amount is determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical change in interest rates on our variable rate debt.\\n\\nIf interest rates were to average 100 basis points lower in 2024 than they were during 2023, our interest income from cash and investment balances would decrease by approximately $7 million. This amount is determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical change in interest rates on the balances of our money market funds and short-term, interest-bearing investments for the trailing twelve-month period.\\n\\n# ITEM 4.

The condensed consolidated financial statements also include McGee Air Services (McGee), a ground services subsidiary of Alaska, and other immaterial business units. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) for interim financial information. Consistent\\n---\\nwith these requirements, this Form 10-Q does not include all the information required by GAAP for complete financial statements. It should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. In the opinion of management, all adjustments have been made that are necessary to fairly present the Company’s financial position as of March 31, 2024 and the results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023. Such adjustments were of a normal recurring nature. Certain rows, columns, figures, or percentages may not recalculate due to rounding. In preparing these statements, the Company is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses, including impairment charges. Due to seasonal variations in the demand for air travel, the volatility of aircraft fuel prices, changes in global economic conditions, changes in the competitive environment, and other factors, operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of operating results for the entire year. Flight 1282 and Boeing 737-9 MAX Grounding\\n\\nAs a result of the Flight 1282 accident and the subsequent grounding of Boeing 737-9 MAX (B737-9) aircraft, Air Group's operation and results were significantly impacted. The Company received compensation from Boeing to address the financial damages incurred as a result of the grounding. As part of this compensation, Boeing paid Air Group $162 million in cash during the first quarter. Subsequent to quarter end, Boeing issued Air Group $61 million in supplier credit memos to be used on future Boeing purchases. Compensation received under the agreement is accounted for as a reduction in cost basis of certain B737-9 aircraft.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"6d8fe3a6-3764-4bd0-9b9b-780675a2656b":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"6d8fe3a6-3764-4bd0-9b9b-780675a2656b\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"c703e0f6-4a5a-4f56-94c4-f58a4a4ad507\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"5xESHM83tG1WNbDVUqCaMstN4vct2oe9RfRSHlPoCeo=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"5d957484-808d-4594-8933-ca4a689aed99\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"3g86tmwDsyVKe4Vd1QPX4g3mzrtiag/otcQUU1zcQns=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"83f6adf0-adbd-4c43-b134-c591ece08f98\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"ewRBLzUuncIJDyEKqbrpqX86IqV7P5wvdwCUElWZFR0=\"}},\"hash\":\"Wbee5Qbay0qJaB9ekzL7COggmPIhvZfIHc4UozA4Mo4=\",\"text\":\"Proceeds received as of March 31, 2024 are reflected within Aircraft and other flight equipment or Deposits for future flight equipment within the condensed consolidated balance sheets. NOTE 2. PROPOSED ACQUISITION OF HAWAIIAN HOLDINGS, INC. On December 2, 2023, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. (Hawaiian). The Company has agreed to pay Hawaiian's shareholders $18.00 per share, or approximately $1.0 billion, in cash for the outstanding shares of Hawaiian. In addition, the Company expects to assume Hawaiian's debt and lease obligations on the date of acquisition. The acquisition has been approved by Hawaiian's shareholders and is subject to final approval by various regulatory bodies. On February 7, 2024, Air Group and Hawaiian each received a request for additional information and documentary material (the “Second Request”) from the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) in connection with the DOJ’s review of the acquisition. On March 27, 2024, Air Group and Hawaiian entered into a timing agreement with the DOJ pursuant to which they agreed, among other things, not to consummate the acquisition before 90 days following the date on which both parties have certified substantial compliance with the Second Request unless they have received written notice from the DOJ prior to the end of such 90-day period that the DOJ has closed its investigation of the acquisition. In the first quarter of 2024, the Company incurred integration costs of $8 million. These costs are classified as special items within the condensed consolidated statements of operations. The Company expects to continue to incur integration costs as activities supporting the proposed acquisition continue. NOTE 3.

The Company's restricted cash balances are primarily used to guarantee various letters of credit, self-insurance programs, or other contractual rights. Restricted cash consists of highly liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less. They are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. Debt: To estimate the fair value of all fixed-rate debt as of March 31, 2024, the Company uses the income approach by discounting cash flows or estimation using quoted market prices, utilizing borrowing rates for comparable debt over the remaining life of the outstanding debt. The estimated fair value of the fixed-rate Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificate (EETC) debt is Level 2, as it is estimated using observable inputs, while the estimated fair value of $582 million of other fixed-rate debt, including PSP notes payable, is classified as Level 3, as it is not actively traded and is valued using discounted cash flows which is an unobservable input.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"3cce00b6-293c-44e8-a163-7786cbdace6b":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"3cce00b6-293c-44e8-a163-7786cbdace6b\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"c703e0f6-4a5a-4f56-94c4-f58a4a4ad507\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"5xESHM83tG1WNbDVUqCaMstN4vct2oe9RfRSHlPoCeo=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"167196b1-88e0-4f40-9d11-ce634a75f28f\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"j4iUCJaAYFfMLyiklLL2UDdlAqgTubADNLu+fA/x4Ak=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"c21d672e-aa1c-438f-9fac-acc05982a9f6\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"PHK8PQtx4QHUuRuBUcQq4VrucMN7o1z53PWtxNwIE78=\"}},\"hash\":\"RL9YZnGtRCq0eyvbVHitVw12To4OWLkYW/9lIKKNO+Y=\",\"text\":\"| |March 31, 2024|December 31, 2023|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Fixed-rate debt|$1,452|$1,515|\\n|Estimated fair value|$1,346|$1,382|\\n\\n# Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\\n\\nCertain assets and liabilities are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including property, plant and equipment, operating and finance lease assets, goodwill, and intangible assets.

As part of the 2016 acquisition of Virgin America, Alaska assumed responsibility for the Virgin trademark license agreement with the Virgin Group. In 2019, pursuant to that agreement's venue provision, the Virgin Group sued Alaska in England, alleging that the agreement requires Alaska to pay $8 million per year as a minimum annual royalty through 2039, adjusted annually for inflation and irrespective of Alaska's actual use (or non-use) of the mark. The possible range of contractual liability is between $10 million and $160 million. Alaska stopped making royalty payments in 2019 after ending all use of the Virgin brand. On February 16, 2023, the commercial court issued a ruling adopting Virgin Group’s interpretation of the license agreement. The Company has appealed the decision and believes the claims in the case are without factual and legal merit, a position supported by Virgin America’s representations during pre-merger due diligence.

Each is regulated by the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Federal Aviation Administration. Alaska has CPAs for regional capacity with Horizon and SkyWest, under which Alaska receives all passenger revenue. Under GAAP, operating segments are defined as components of a business for which there is discrete financial information that is regularly assessed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) in making resource allocation decisions. Historically, our CODM has reviewed financial performance information for our airline operations and Horizon CPA as part of three reportable operating segments:\\n\\n- Mainline - includes scheduled air transportation on Alaska's Boeing jet aircraft for passengers and cargo throughout the U.S., and in parts of Canada, Mexico, Costa Rica, Belize, Guatemala, and the Bahamas. ---\\n# Operating Segments\\n\\nRegional - includes Horizon's and other third-party carriers’ scheduled air transportation for passengers across a shorter distance network within the U.S., Canada, and Mexico under a CPA. This segment includes the actual revenue and expenses associated with regional flying, as well as an allocation of corporate overhead incurred by Air Group on behalf of the regional operations. Horizon - includes the capacity sold to Alaska under CPA. Expenses include those typically borne by regional airlines such as crew costs, ownership costs, and maintenance costs. In addition to these reported segments, we have a \\\"Consolidating and Other\\\" column which reflects Air Group parent company activity, McGee Air Services, consolidating entries, and other immaterial business units of the company. The “Air Group Adjusted” column represents a non-GAAP measure that is used by the Company's CODM to evaluate performance and allocate resources. Adjustments are further explained below in reconciling to consolidated GAAP results. Over time, our Mainline and Regional airline segments have increasingly been managed as a single component that provides scheduled air transportation for passengers and cargo, and includes our loyalty program. Managing this component in an integrated manner enables our team to leverage our comprehensive network, single route scheduling system, and fleet as a single business to deliver optimized consolidated financial results. In the first quarter of 2024, management began evaluating changes to internal reporting that may change the discrete information that is provided to our CODM in the future to better align with the way the business is managed. Such changes may have an impact on the company’s reportable segments once finalized.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"a6b25ad2-d9e1-4bec-b4df-3061d1bf8927":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"a6b25ad2-d9e1-4bec-b4df-3061d1bf8927\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"c703e0f6-4a5a-4f56-94c4-f58a4a4ad507\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"5xESHM83tG1WNbDVUqCaMstN4vct2oe9RfRSHlPoCeo=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"5c969e7f-1691-4108-a32d-4ce87c51c240\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"gAbNmMkdokMorON/quozfYqpsewDdw8NbvYEd1fMZoM=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"e3c7c100-353a-4704-ac36-8f76592f79b6\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"MpgF5lq/cFbMG/b/nkS5QbktGKwRaSt/iOO40g/qRmQ=\"}},\"hash\":\"X6mkuPhJm+nY1bJLOeE9hm6XcOhoQmmmdlKpByJ5VGI=\",\"text\":\"Such changes may have an impact on the company’s reportable segments once finalized.

We believe that consideration of these non-GAAP financial measures may be important to investors for the following reasons:\\n\\n- By excluding certain costs from our unit metrics, we believe that we have better visibility into the results of operations. Our industry is highly competitive and is characterized by high fixed costs, so even a small reduction in non-fuel operating costs can result in a significant improvement in operating results. We believe that all domestic carriers are similarly impacted by changes in jet fuel costs over the long run, so it is important for management and investors to understand the impact of company-specific cost drivers which are more controllable by management. We adjust for expenses related directly to our freighter aircraft operations to allow for better comparability to other domestic carriers that do not operate freighter aircraft. We also exclude certain special charges as they are unusual or nonrecurring in nature and adjusting for these expenses allows management and investors to better understand our cost performance. - CASMex is one of the most important measures used by management and by the Air Group Board of Directors in assessing quarterly and annual cost performance. CASMex is also a measure commonly used by industry analysts, and we believe it is the basis by which they have historically compared our airline to others in the industry. The measure is also the subject of frequent questions from investors. - Adjusted pretax income is an important metric for the employee incentive plan, which covers the majority of Air Group employees. - Disclosure of the individual impact of certain noted items provides investors the ability to measure and monitor performance both with and without these special items. We believe that disclosing the impact of these items as noted. ---\\n# Above is important because it provides information on significant items that are not necessarily indicative of future performance. Industry analysts and investors consistently measure our performance without these items for better comparability between periods and among other airlines. Although we disclose our unit revenue, we do not, nor are we able to, evaluate unit revenue excluding the impact that changes in fuel costs have had on ticket prices.

Despite the impacts of Flight 1282 and the subsequent grounding of the B737-9 fleet, which are outlined more fully below, the Company recorded record first quarter revenue bolstered by strategic capacity deployment and strong leisure and business demand. Revenue improvement, combined with a $100 million decrease in aircraft fuel costs, offset by increased non-fuel operating expenses drove the year-over-year improvement in pretax loss.

We also evaluate economic fuel expense, which we define as raw fuel expense adjusted for the cash we receive from hedge counterparties for hedges that settle during the period and for the premium expense that we paid for those contracts. A key difference between aircraft fuel expense and economic fuel expense is the timing of gain or loss recognition on our hedge portfolio. Economic fuel expense includes gains and losses only when they are realized for those contracts that were settled during the period based on their original contract terms. We believe this is the best measure of the effect that fuel prices are currently having on our business as it most closely approximates the net cash outflow associated with purchasing fuel for our operations. Accordingly, many industry analysts evaluate our results using this measure, and it is the basis for most internal management reporting and incentive pay plans. Losses recognized for hedges that settled during the first quarter were $13 million in 2024, compared to losses of $12 million in the same period in 2023. These amounts represent cash paid for premium expense, offset by any cash received from those hedges at settlement. In 2023, we suspended our crude oil hedge program.

Cash provided by ticket sales and from our co-branded credit card agreement are the primary sources of our operating cash flow. Our primary use of operating cash flow is for operating expenses, including payments for employee wages and benefits, payments to suppliers for goods and services, and payments to lessors and airport authorities for rents and landing fees. Operating cash flow also includes payments to, or refunds from, federal, state, and local taxing authorities. The $70 million net increase in our operating cash flows was due to a combination of factors.

These amounts were partially offset by other changes in working capital accounts. Cash Provided by Investing Activities\\n\\nCash provided by investing activities was $318 million during the first three months of 2024, compared to $60 million in 2023. The change was due to a combination of factors. In the first quarter, the Company received $162 million in compensation from Boeing related to the B737-9 grounding, which is presented as Supplier proceeds. Total property and equipment expenditures decreased $67 million as we took no deliveries of B737-9 aircraft in the first quarter of 2024 compared to three owned B737-9 deliveries in the prior period, and due to changes in\\n---\\ncontractual terms of our aircraft purchase deposit schedule with Boeing. Cash flows from other investing activities increased $96 million due to the sale of certain A321neo aircraft. These changes were partially offset by decreased cash flows from net sales of marketable securities, which were $120 million in 2024, compared to $187 million in 2023. Cash Used in Financing Activities\\n\\nCash used in financing activities was $5 million during the first three months of 2024, compared to $114 million in 2023. The change was largely driven by $149 million in new debt proceeds in 2024 compared to zero in 2023, partially offset by increased cash used in other financing activities, of which the settlement of our final A321neo finance lease was the largest component. MATERIAL CASH COMMITMENTS\\n\\nMaterial cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations. In prior filings, we had indicated our expected capital expenditures for 2024 would be approximately $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion.

Debt Obligations and Interest Obligations\\n\\nThe Company primarily issues debt to fund purchases of aircraft or other capital expenditures. At March 31, 2024, our debt portfolio carries a weighted average interest rate of 4.6%. Interest is paid with regular debt service. Debt service obligations remaining in 2024 are expected to be approximately $300 million, inclusive of interest and principal. Refer to Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt and interest balances. CPA and Other Obligations\\n\\nWe have obligations primarily associated with our capacity purchase agreements between Alaska and SkyWest, as well as other various sponsorship agreements and investment commitments. Leased Aircraft Return Costs\\n\\nFor leased aircraft, contractual terms require us to return the aircraft in a specified state. As a result of these contractual terms, we incur significant costs to return these aircraft at the termination of the lease. Costs to return leased aircraft are accrued when the costs are probable and reasonably estimable, usually over the twelve months prior to the lease return or any expected early retirement date, unless a determination is made to remove the leased asset from operation. If the leased aircraft is removed from the operating fleet, the estimated cost to return is accrued at the time of removal. Lease return accrual estimates are based on the time remaining on the lease and the provisions included in the lease agreement, although the actual amount due to any lessor upon return may not be known with certainty until lease termination. At March 31, 2024, $90 million is accrued for lease returns, and classified within Other accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Credit Card Agreements\\n\\nAlaska has agreements with a number of credit card companies to process the sale of tickets and other services.

We anticipate these efforts will require cash outlays, not all of which are reflected in our contractual commitments. Finding and establishing relationships with suppliers to meet these commitments is in process. Currently, Alaska has certain agreements to purchase SAF to be delivered in the coming years. These agreements are dependent on suppliers' ability to obtain all required governmental and regulatory approvals, achieve commercial operation, and produce sufficient quantities of SAF. Financial commitments that have been contractually established and have defined minimum obligations, including those related to Alaska Star Ventures, are included within the CPA and other obligations row in the above table. # Income Taxes\\n\\nFor federal income tax purposes, the majority of our property and equipment are fully depreciated over a seven-year life using an accelerated depreciation method or bonus depreciation, if available. For financial reporting purposes, the majority of our assets are depreciated over 15 to 25 years to an estimated salvage value using the straight-line basis. This difference has created a significant deferred tax liability. At some point in the future, the property and equipment difference will reverse into taxable income, potentially resulting in an increase in income taxes payable. While it is possible that we could have material cash obligations for this deferred liability at some point in the future, we cannot estimate the timing of long-term cash flows with reasonable accuracy. Taxable income and cash taxes payable in the short term are impacted by many items, including the amount of book income generated (which can be volatile depending on revenue and fuel prices, among other factors out of our control), whether bonus depreciation provisions are available, as well as other legislative changes beyond our control.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"b9b03eb8-adc3-48c3-a8c3-29b8c6a259d4":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"b9b03eb8-adc3-48c3-a8c3-29b8c6a259d4\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"c703e0f6-4a5a-4f56-94c4-f58a4a4ad507\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"5xESHM83tG1WNbDVUqCaMstN4vct2oe9RfRSHlPoCeo=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"568ff5f3-892a-47f6-9412-d6a04f2c51ac\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"/3wBy1Pez/NFnZuSrPfDGnLHnQC4oHSi2rDrFCsdUjo=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"89859258-6a82-4704-8c31-f7d32fdea844\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"KDqe96Pkvs6zfOZyfQzHqwFW+jB3UQibjXLkucOdx4Q=\"}},\"hash\":\"DVk+7cj9ANRXcziYznizxr3qv3CgXc8SLo5XC2UESbU=\",\"text\":\"We believe we have the liquidity to make our future tax payments. # Proposed Acquisition of Hawaiian Holdings Inc.

As part of the 2016 acquisition of Virgin America, Alaska assumed responsibility for the Virgin trademark license agreement with the Virgin Group. In 2019, pursuant to that agreement's venue provision, the Virgin Group sued Alaska in England, alleging that the agreement requires Alaska to pay $8 million per year as a minimum annual royalty through 2039, adjusted annually for inflation and irrespective of Alaska's actual use (or non-use) of the mark. The possible range of contractual liability is between $10 million and $160 million. Alaska stopped making royalty payments in 2019 after ending all use of the Virgin brand. On February 16, 2023, the commercial court issued a ruling adopting Virgin Group’s interpretation of the license agreement. The Company has appealed the decision and believes the claims in the case are without factual and legal merit, a position supported by Virgin America’s representations during pre-merger due diligence. Alaska also commenced a separate claim for breach of the agreement against the Virgin Group that may affect the Company’s total liability in the matter. On April 15, 2024, a private antitrust action captioned Warren Yoshimoto, et al., v. Alaska Airlines, Inc., et al. was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii, against Alaska Airlines, Inc. and Alaska Air Group, Inc. The plaintiffs, whom the complaint describes as airline passengers, allege that the pending acquisition of Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. by Alaska Airlines, Inc. would violate U.S. antitrust laws. They seek to enjoin the merger or obtain divestitures, as well as costs and attorneys’ fees. The Company believes the allegations in the complaint are without merit and will defend against them vigorously, while continuing to work cooperatively with the U.S. Department of Justice to obtain regulatory clearance to close the acquisition. # ITEM 1A.

Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP\\n\\nAtlanta, Georgia April 10, 2024\\n\\n# Financial Statements\\n\\n**DELTA AIR LINES, INC.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"b5c42f6a-91d5-4c26-a438-eb7dc6ea320b":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"b5c42f6a-91d5-4c26-a438-eb7dc6ea320b\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"c703e0f6-4a5a-4f56-94c4-f58a4a4ad507\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"5xESHM83tG1WNbDVUqCaMstN4vct2oe9RfRSHlPoCeo=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"3d3436f6-cc5a-437d-8157-5a230fc68802\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"aUGGFFkf7RQfhd4p8YLx/EqpduKxs4NIAF/UtlPTcLo=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"2d17c035-364f-4420-b184-c3d50a5a1cd2\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"C9IrMHCmsZnuhcJkg3GC1Kc0wL21zzWOf0Fq9I5ehkY=\"}},\"hash\":\"LUTt4Wx4loqjU81UT0boMRdwiRzCWNU6969SMeQ61Oo=\",\"text\":\"Consolidated Balance Sheets (Unaudited) March 31, December 31, (in millions, except share data)**\\n|ASSETS|March 31, 2024|December 31, 2023|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Current Assets:| | |\\n|Cash and cash equivalents|$3,877|$2,741|\\n|Short-term investments|$589|$1,127|\\n|Accounts receivable, net of allowance for uncollectible accounts of $16 and $17|$3,748|$3,130|\\n|Fuel, expendable parts and supplies inventories, net of allowance for obsolescence of $124 and $123|$1,452|$1,314|\\n|Prepaid expenses and other|$1,913|$1,957|\\n|Total current assets|$11,579|$10,269|\\n|Noncurrent Assets:| | |\\n|Property and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization of $22,156 and $21,707|$35,915|$35,486|\\n---\\n# Operating lease right-of-use assets\\n\\n6,785\\n7,004\\n\\n# Goodwill\\n\\n9,753\\n9,753\\n\\n# Identifiable intangibles, net of accumulated amortization of $913 and $911\\n\\n5,981\\n5,983\\n\\n# Equity investments\\n\\n3,247\\n3,457\\n\\n# Other noncurrent assets\\n\\n1,709\\n1,692\\n\\n# Total noncurrent assets\\n\\n63,390\\n63,375\\n\\n# Total assets\\n\\n$ 74,969\\n$ 73,644\\n\\n# Current Liabilities:\\n\\n# LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\\n\\n| | | |\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Current maturities of debt and finance leases|$ 2,809|$ 2,983|\\n|Current maturities of operating leases|742|759|\\n|Air traffic liability|10,193|7,044|\\n|Accounts payable|4,541|4,446|\\n|Accrued salaries and related benefits|3,037|4,561|\\n|Loyalty program deferred revenue|4,018|3,908|\\n|Fuel card obligation|1,100|1,100|\\n|Other accrued liabilities|2,038|1,617|\\n|Total current liabilities|28,478|26,418|\\n\\n# Noncurrent Liabilities:\\n\\n| | | |\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Debt and finance leases|16,555|17,071|\\n|Pension, postretirement and related benefits|3,524|3,601|\\n|Loyalty program deferred revenue|4,523|4,512|\\n|Noncurrent operating leases|6,203|6,468|\\n|Deferred income taxes, net|994|908|\\n|Other noncurrent liabilities|3,541|3,561|\\n|Total noncurrent liabilities|35,340|36,121|\\n\\n# Commitments and Contingencies\\n\\n# Stockholders' Equity:\\n\\n| | | |\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Common stock at $0.0001 par value;

Our SkyMiles loyalty program allows customers to earn miles by flying on Delta, Delta Connection and other airlines that participate in the loyalty program. Customers can also earn miles through participating companies, such as credit card, retail, ridesharing, car rental and hotel companies, who purchase miles from us. Our most significant contract to sell miles relates to our co-brand credit card relationship with American Express.

Cash equivalents generally consist of money market funds. Restricted cash equivalents generally consist of money market funds, time deposits, commercial paper and negotiable certificates of deposit. Restricted cash equivalents primarily relate to proceeds from debt issued to finance, among other things, a portion of the construction costs for our new terminal facilities at New York's LaGuardia Airport as well as certain self-insurance obligations and airport commitments. Restricted cash equivalents are recorded in prepaid expenses and other on our Consolidated Balance Sheet (\\\"balance sheet\\\"). The fair value of these cash equivalents is based on a market approach using prices generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets. Short-Term Investments. The fair values of our short-term investments are based on a market approach using industry standard valuation techniques that incorporate observable inputs such as quoted market prices, interest rates, benchmark curves, credit ratings of the security and other observable information. These investments are expected to mature in one year or less. Long-Term Investments and Related. Our long-term investments measured at fair value primarily consist of equity investments, which are valued based on market prices or other observable transactions and inputs, and are recorded in equity investments on our balance sheet. Our equity investments in private companies are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy as their equity is not traded on a public exchange and our valuations incorporate certain unobservable inputs, including non-public equity issuances. Fair value measurement using unobservable inputs is inherently uncertain, and a change in significant inputs could result in different fair values. See Note 4, \\\"Investments,\\\" for further information on our equity investments. Fuel Hedge Contracts. Our derivative contracts to hedge the financial risk from changing fuel prices are related to inventory at our wholly-owned subsidiary, Monroe Energy, LLC (\\\"Monroe\\\").\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"ab2738c5-91a3-497c-903a-f69c9c9e18c1":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"ab2738c5-91a3-497c-903a-f69c9c9e18c1\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"c703e0f6-4a5a-4f56-94c4-f58a4a4ad507\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"5xESHM83tG1WNbDVUqCaMstN4vct2oe9RfRSHlPoCeo=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"3d4e529f-a8ad-4549-bab1-1f9d4bab87b3\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"mfn4n0z/e9rHwO6mobzrQ+mc5ssm7TB1+WOnHumRSj8=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"ffa59af9-579c-4f34-b6cc-af96f4f31e15\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"KI+qWm29B4z7m4lVABKIwEUbqSBPS4hlV99WYSUJODY=\"}},\"hash\":\"6Y/hEGsEFuT0V7ZTZd2Ct/SSOlUvcGkPM/ZJ0mjb5zU=\",\"text\":\"We recognized losses of $96 million and gains of $31 million on our fuel hedge contracts in aircraft fuel and related taxes on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income/(Loss) (\\\"income statement\\\") for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

Revenue. Compared to the March 2023 quarter, our total revenue increased $989 million, or 8%, due primarily to a 7% increase in capacity and continued strength in travel demand across all geographic regions, particularly for our premium products. Total revenue, adjusted (a non-GAAP financial measure, which excludes revenue related to refinery sales to third parties) increased in the March 2024 quarter by $721 million, or 6%, compared to the March 2023 quarter. Operating Expense. Total operating expense in the March 2024 quarter increased $98 million, or 1%, compared to the March 2023 quarter, primarily due to higher employee costs from increased wages and profit sharing and increased costs associated with higher capacity, partially offset by the one-time pilot agreement-related expenses in 2023. Total operating expense, adjusted (a non-GAAP financial measure) in the March 2024 quarter increased $627 million, or 6%, compared to the March 2023 quarter.

Our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and aggregate undrawn principal amount available under our revolving credit facilities (\\\"liquidity\\\") as of March 31, 2024, was $7.4 billion. During the March 2024 quarter, operating activities generated $2.4 billion. Cash flows from operating activities benefited from the sale of tickets to managed corporate customers, including tickets for travel during and beyond the quarter, which grew 14% during the March 2024 quarter compared to the March 2023 quarter, led by large accounts, particularly in the technology, consumer services, and financial services sectors. In addition, total cash sales to American Express were $1.7 billion in the March 2024 quarter, an increase of approximately 5% compared to the March 2023 quarter. Cash flows used in investing activities during the quarter totaled $637 million as capital expenditures were partially offset by redemptions of short-term investments.

Fuel expense represented approximately 20% and 21% of our total operating expense for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The market price for jet fuel is volatile, which can impact the comparability of our periodic cash flows from operations. The market price for jet fuel was lower in the March quarter 2024 compared to the March quarter 2023. Fuel consumption was higher during the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the prior year period due to the increase in capacity. We continue to expect that fuel consumption for the full year 2024 will increase compared to 2023 aligned with capacity, partially offset by increases in the fuel efficiency of our fleet. Profit Sharing. We paid $1.4 billion in profit sharing payments in February 2024 related to our 2023 pre-tax profit in recognition of our employees' contributions toward achieving the year's financial results. This is an increase compared to our profit sharing payment made in February 2023, where we paid $563 million in profit sharing related to our 2022 pre-tax profit. Our broad-based employee profit sharing program provides that for each year in which we have an annual pre-tax profit, as defined by the terms of the program, we will pay a specified portion of that profit to eligible employees. In determining the amount of profit sharing, the program defines profit as pre-tax profit adjusted for profit sharing and certain other items. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, we accrued $125 million in profit sharing expense based on the year-to-date performance and current expectations for 2024 profit. Sale of Miles to Participating Companies. Customers earn miles based on their spending with participating companies such as credit card, retail, ridesharing, car rental and hotel companies with which we have marketing agreements to sell miles. Payments are typically due to us monthly based on the volume of miles sold during the period. Our most significant contract to sell miles relates to our co-brand credit card relationship with American Express. Total cash sales to American Express were $1.7 billion in the three months ended March 31, 2024, an increase of 5% compared to the prior year period.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"b32097d9-fc8c-4340-ac3b-8276d3a50d36":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"b32097d9-fc8c-4340-ac3b-8276d3a50d36\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"c703e0f6-4a5a-4f56-94c4-f58a4a4ad507\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"5xESHM83tG1WNbDVUqCaMstN4vct2oe9RfRSHlPoCeo=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"80595e60-8192-4278-9989-80b442c26a2c\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"9XtQ+vX/st/t8I5GMxPT39pjzDJIrnCS1174FFEJDzw=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"82bba173-5d7a-401e-84c8-3ed221a9453a\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"hdcE1QXQqxQUZYgZs0s626I1Mlb/tGA3xiL80W7Rv+0=\"}},\"hash\":\"G3bmtBHRG77GU9YgseWpno2+Axw0MAyX0pSJ2LulXvs=\",\"text\":\"See Note 2 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding the cash sales from marketing agreements.

Our capital expenditures were $1.2 billion and $1.0 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. We have committed to future aircraft purchases and have obtained, but are under no obligation to use, long-term financing commitments for a substantial portion of the purchase price of the aircraft. Our expected 2024 capital spend of approximately $5.0 billion, excluding the New York-LaGuardia airport project discussed below, will be primarily for aircraft, including deliveries and advance deposit payments, as well as fleet modifications and technology enhancements and may vary depending on financing decisions. New York-LaGuardia Redevelopment. As part of the terminal redevelopment project at LaGuardia Airport, we are partnering with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to replace Terminals C and D with a new state-of-the-art terminal facility. Construction is ongoing with completion expected by the end of 2024. Using funding primarily provided by existing financing arrangements and other sources of funding, we expect to spend approximately $400 million on this project during 2024, of which $93 million was incurred in the three months ended March 31, 2024. ---\\n# Financing Activities\\n\\nDebt and Finance Leases. In the three months ended March 31, 2024, we had cash outflows of $712 million related to repayments of our debt and finance lease obligations.

Completion of the Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including approval by the Company's stockholders, which was obtained on February 16, 2024; performance by the parties in all material respects of all their obligations under the Merger Agreement; the receipt of required regulatory approvals; and the absence of an order or law preventing, materially restraining, or materially impairing the consummation of the Merger.

On March 27, 2024, the Company and Alaska entered into a timing agreement with the DOJ pursuant to which we agreed, among other things, not to consummate the Merger before 90 days following the date on which both parties have certified substantial compliance with the Second Request unless we have received written notice from the DOJ prior to the end of such 90-day period that the DOJ has closed its investigation of the Merger.

393 positions out of 495 positions and 394 positions out of 502 positions, respectively. The Company reviews debt securities quarterly for credit losses and impairment. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, the Company will evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to which the fair value is less than cost. This determination requires significant judgment. In making this judgment, the Company employs a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of its investments.

Fair Value Measurements\\n\\nAccounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement (ASC 820), defines fair value as an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, ASC 820 establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:\\n\\n- Level 1 — Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\\n- Level 2 — Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term for the assets or liabilities; and\\n- Level 3 — Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

To finance the aircraft, the Company entered into (a) a $115.0 million senior note maturing in April 2034 with a variable interest rate based on SOFR plus 350 basis points, and (b) a $15.0 million junior note maturing in April 2029 with a fixed interest rate of 8.8693%. Principal and interest payments on the notes are due quarterly. In order to complete the purchase of these aircraft and fund related costs, the Company may need to secure acceptable financing. Financing may be necessary to satisfy the Company's capital commitments for firm order aircraft and other related capital expenditures. The Company can provide no assurance that any financing not already in place for aircraft and spare engine deliveries will be available to us on acceptable terms when necessary or at all. The Company has commitments with third-party service providers for reservations, information technology, and accounting services through 2033. Committed capital and other expenditures include escalation and variable amounts based on estimated forecasts. The gross committed expenditures and committed payments as of March 31, 2024 and for the next five fiscal years and thereafter are detailed below:\\n\\n|Aircraft and Aircraft Related|Other|Total Committed Expenditures|\\n|---|---|---|\\n|Remaining in 2024|$225,949|$20,204|$246,153|\\n|2025|$419,557|$18,328|$437,885|\\n|2026|$665,473|$12,085|$677,558|\\n|2027|$252,872|$8,270|$261,142|\\n|2028|-|$3,311|$3,311|\\n|Thereafter|-|$58,285|$58,285|\\n|Total|$1,563,851|$120,483|$1,684,334|\\n\\nLitigation and Contingencies\\n\\nThe Company is subject to legal proceedings arising in the normal course of its operations.

It is common in such lease transactions for the lessee to agree to indemnify the lessor and other related third parties for tort liabilities that arise out of, or relate to, the lessee’s use of the leased aircraft or occupancy of the leased premises. In some cases, this indemnity extends to related liabilities arising from the negligence of the indemnified parties, but usually excludes any liabilities caused by such parties' gross negligence or willful misconduct. Additionally, the lessee typically indemnifies such parties for any environmental liability that arises out of or relates to the lessee's use of the real estate leased premises. The Company believes that it is insured (subject to deductibles) for most of the tort liabilities and related indemnities\\n---\\ndescribed above with respect to the aircraft and real estate that it leases. The Company cannot reasonably estimate the potential amount of future payments, if any, under the foregoing indemnities and agreements. Credit Card Holdbacks\\n\\nUnder the Company’s bank-issued credit card processing agreements, proceeds from advance ticket sales may be held back to serve as collateral to cover any possible chargebacks or other disputed charges that may occur. As of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, there were no holdbacks held with the Company's credit card processors. In the event of a material adverse change in the Company's business, the credit card processor could increase holdbacks to up to 100% of the amount of outstanding credit card tickets that are unflown (e.g., air traffic liability, excluding frequent flyer deferred revenue), which would result in a restriction of cash. If the Company were unable to obtain a waiver of, or otherwise mitigate the increase in the restriction of cash, it could have a material impact on the Company's operations, business or financial condition.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"2179f989-3765-44c5-a2d8-30a5c97fda1b":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"2179f989-3765-44c5-a2d8-30a5c97fda1b\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"c703e0f6-4a5a-4f56-94c4-f58a4a4ad507\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"5xESHM83tG1WNbDVUqCaMstN4vct2oe9RfRSHlPoCeo=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"8f0a1a5a-3742-430e-9758-355acbcf45a6\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"rWGxmr4/Xb4v0hOwr4kuUaMjdwV9pqgIwEAJn0ysfLQ=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"9996b6bf-cce5-4b4d-82a3-f6860fb6f9d4\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"ppGweZWBDjINET14laG7IbYxkHpn/ZnfMIMbgN8JpT8=\"}},\"hash\":\"8tWmi8QC2FvaoyGES9Tl5yDLYcFKzHEmFx8Ow6G+K34=\",\"text\":\"|Assets Held-For-Sale Activity for the three months ended March 31, 2024|\\n|---|\\n| |ATR Aircraft|Commercial Real Estate|Total|\\n|Beginning balance as of December 31, 2023|$1,135 (in thousands)|—|$1,135|\\n|Additions|—|—|—|\\n|Proceeds from sale|(105)|—|(105)|\\n|Realized gains|61|—|61|\\n|Realized losses|—|—|—|\\n|Ending balance as of March 31, 2024|$1,091|—|$1,091|\\n---\\n# Assets Held-For-Sale Activity for the three months ended March 31, 2023\\n\\n| |Commercial Real Estate|ATR Aircraft|Total|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Beginning balance as of December 31, 2022|$6,291|$7,728|$14,019|\\n|Additions|—|—|—|\\n|Proceeds from sale|($16,470)|($2,769)|($19,239)|\\n|Realized gains|$10,179|$65|$10,244|\\n|Realized losses|—|—|—|\\n|Ending balance as of March 31, 2023|$—|$5,024|$5,024|\\n\\nIn February 2023, the Company entered into a sale agreement for the sale of its commercial real estate and recognized a gain on sale of $10.2 million, which was recorded in Other operating expense in the consolidated statements of operations.

Economic fuel expense is calculated as follows:\\n---\\n# Three months ended March 31, 2024 2023 % Change\\n\\n| |2024|2023|% Change|\\n|---|---|---|---|\\n|Aircraft fuel expense, including taxes and delivery|$188,778|$197,625|(4.5)%|\\n|Realized losses on settlement of fuel derivative contracts|$2,398|$1,513|58.5 %|\\n|Economic fuel expense|$191,176|$199,138|(4.0)%|\\n|Fuel gallons consumed|67,651|64,853|4.3 %|\\n|Economic fuel price per gallon|$2.83|$3.07|(7.8)%|\\n\\nWe expect that fuel gallons consumed will be up between 2.5% to 5.0% during the second quarter of 2024 as compared to the same period in 2023.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"0ec60689-e3b9-420a-9668-43a42d75c13c":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"0ec60689-e3b9-420a-9668-43a42d75c13c\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"c703e0f6-4a5a-4f56-94c4-f58a4a4ad507\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"5xESHM83tG1WNbDVUqCaMstN4vct2oe9RfRSHlPoCeo=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"b31a395f-8b47-4c6b-854b-04af83f1727b\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"SQ6ySiTe6VV3WcN1qIuBTApeQ3Xo+uTypo3z44m7DPU=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"ad322293-7efe-4190-b53c-13dee25fd16c\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"NhTIbj7tLxPGLnuEKfbcy4cM5mkU+jcRpF6KB9vhjxQ=\"}},\"hash\":\"DFVRHNxPJjmtmvTtFg+5F8EUwhEj2lBBeR/t72FyohU=\",\"text\":\"Maintenance, materials and repairs\\n\\nMaintenance, materials and repairs expense increased $20.7 million, or 41.1%, during the three months ended March 31, 2024, as compared to the same period in 2023.

Aircraft Fuel. Fuel expense represented approximately 23.8% of our total operating expense during the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to 27.1% during the same period in 2023.

Based on that evaluation, our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2024 to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. # Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\\n\\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2024, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. # Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\\n\\nA control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, will be detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"fefdfeb5-4e0d-40dc-abfa-43164abbb4b5":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"fefdfeb5-4e0d-40dc-abfa-43164abbb4b5\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"c703e0f6-4a5a-4f56-94c4-f58a4a4ad507\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"5xESHM83tG1WNbDVUqCaMstN4vct2oe9RfRSHlPoCeo=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"21ead43f-61f0-4289-bfd3-27c656134f01\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"LeXtSUIarGO4y7C1YiMkCUAsTtRYVtG5LonCDqM9YAQ=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"b0c0421e-24cf-4697-8d9f-df3244d58680\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"TfEJHRIRwg2eL4bkRO9O0o4DxRf895B/Lwt3vck5PFg=\"}},\"hash\":\"TM4nCeRdzIgrwVYKfe9SnEKO6UVpGT8/jGWr08jr+7k=\",\"text\":\"Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks.

These restrictions may affect our ability to execute our business strategies and attain our financial and other goals and may impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition. The pendency of the Merger could cause disruptions to our business or business relationships, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Parties with which we have business relationships, including guests, employees and labor groups, suppliers, third-party service providers, and third-party distribution channels, may be uncertain as to the future of such relationships and may delay or defer certain business decisions, seek alternative relationships with third parties or seek to alter their present business relationships with us. Parties with whom we otherwise may have sought to establish business relationships may seek alternative relationships with third parties. The pursuit of the Merger is expected to place a significant burden on our management and internal resources. The diversion of management’s attention away from day-to-day business concerns and any difficulties encountered in the transition and integration process could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs, expenses, and fees in connection with the Merger. The substantial majority of these costs will be non-recurring expenses relating to the Merger, and many of these costs are payable regardless of whether or not the Merger is consummated. Litigation has been filed in connection with the Merger, and further litigation may arise prior to closing. Defending the litigation could prove costly and time-consuming. Failure to complete the Merger in a timely manner or at all could negatively impact the market price of our common stock, as well as our future business and our results of operations and financial condition.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"7cdc2c32-df3e-420a-8543-7f5ad77dc585":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"7cdc2c32-df3e-420a-8543-7f5ad77dc585\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"c703e0f6-4a5a-4f56-94c4-f58a4a4ad507\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"5xESHM83tG1WNbDVUqCaMstN4vct2oe9RfRSHlPoCeo=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"5ee44655-21c5-462f-8846-fef8f2015021\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"oexjEtbTvYvgYIePtn1/3e+Dy+mtcBhHY2l6zErGSho=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"062305f2-82da-4169-a304-24a18e8ea960\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"E1Jrb1/tOk/spiNTz7XClRSuz80qqQm7NiJ1MsXi5ks=\"}},\"hash\":\"U/EaUcX5UlxlY3tB0TICCszlVGbpScSIlRy+920Z2OY=\",\"text\":\"The Merger cannot be completed until the conditions to closing are satisfied or (if permissible under applicable law) waived.

Our business has historically focused on passenger flights. The ATSA with Amazon is anticipated to increase our cargo operations. Historically, our revenue from non-passenger operations, which includes cargo, accounted for approximately 9.4%, 11.6%, and 14.1% of total revenue during the years ending December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, our revenue from non-passenger operations accounted for 9.6% of our total revenue. Under the ATSA, cargo operations are expected to account for a larger portion of our revenue. Our cargo operations for Amazon may not generate the levels of revenue anticipated. We expect to incur additional costs in order to ramp up and prepare for increased cargo operations, including hiring crew, opening mainland bases and preparing to provide line maintenance for the Amazon fleet. Our pre-service efforts could be costly and be time-consuming and distracting to our management. Additionally, we will incur costs before we generate revenue from our cargo operations for Amazon, which may negatively impact our business and results of operations. Once we begin generating revenue from cargo operations for Amazon, some or all of that revenue will be offset against the value of Amazon’s vested warrant shares due to our accounting policies. # ECONOMIC RISKS\\n\\nOur business is affected by global economic volatility, including any future economic downturns.

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced a significant decrease in demand for air travel and reduced load capacity on flights. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, our passenger revenue was $583.4 million, up approximately $34.9 million compared to 2023, but down $17.9 million, or 3.0% from the pre-pandemic period in 2019. Across our\\n---\\nbusiness and as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have faced operational challenges, including continued delay in the recovery of international travel. Our business depends on the demand for travel to, from and within the Hawaiian Islands and such demand for discretionary air travel remains unpredictable. Further deterioration or instability in demand, including resulting from any future pandemic or other public health related travel restrictions, recommendations or other impacts on travel behavior, such as those that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic, ongoing economic uncertainty or recession may result in sustained reduction in our passenger traffic and/or increased competitive pressure on fares in the markets we serve, which could continue to negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance that we will be able to offset passenger revenue reductions with other revenue, by reducing our costs or by seeking financing arrangements or other programs or opportunities. We also may not have sufficient cash flows to support our debt obligations, on which more detail is provided in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, a rapid economic expansion following the height of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significant inflationary pressures and volatility in certain currencies, which have increased our costs for aircraft fuel, wages and other goods and services we require to operate our business. In 2023, concerns arose with respect to the financial condition of certain banking institutions in the United States, in particular those with exposure to certain types of depositors and large portfolios of investment securities. In March 2023, both Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and Signature Bank (Signature) entered receivership. While we do not maintain accounts with either SVB or Signature, we maintain our cash at other financial institutions in balances that exceed the current Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"9531a790-a534-4a44-8704-e278e5d7983b":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"9531a790-a534-4a44-8704-e278e5d7983b\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"c703e0f6-4a5a-4f56-94c4-f58a4a4ad507\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"5xESHM83tG1WNbDVUqCaMstN4vct2oe9RfRSHlPoCeo=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"09f36f8c-9bc5-42b9-ad15-ca39c718fa2b\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"Z/fHTT5xLbO5YwiNJJTi0+HUo8bs81bRoGvv1lpQ8Wg=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"a924b58f-3a9e-492e-ae64-d6b4050870bc\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"Z75SIXwK98+WPJpjoF5EBinGqy0m/rzeXHXI0+6bzos=\"}},\"hash\":\"VpDqDoqKF7aXYhxbPef9dcnoU/QAZy/Ir762LdSoZJQ=\",\"text\":\"If more banks and financial institutions experience financial hardship, enter receivership or become insolvent in the future due to financial conditions affecting the banking system and financial markets, our ability to access our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments may be threatened and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Our business is highly dependent on tourism to, from, and amongst the Hawaiian Islands and our financial results have been impacted and may continue to be impacted by the current and any future downturn in tourism levels. Our principal base of operations is in Hawai'i and our revenue is linked primarily to the number of travelers (mainly tourists) to, from and amongst the Hawaiian Islands. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and government mandates related to travel, we experienced a significant decline in the demand for travel to, from and amongst the Hawaiian Islands. The State of Hawai'i stopped imposing quarantine, testing and vaccination requirements at the end of the first quarter of 2022, but certain foreign government restrictions remained in effect for international travelers during 2022. We have and will continue to incur costs as we further increase our number of flights as passenger traffic to and within the Hawaiian Islands increases, which we incur before the anticipated additional revenue is earned. Hawai'i tourism levels are generally affected by the economic and political climate impacting air travel and tourism markets generally, including the availability of hotel accommodations, the popularity of tourist destinations relative to other vacation destinations, and other global factors including health crises, natural disasters, safety, and security. While we have seen some increased tourism activity in the state of Hawai'i since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot predict if and when tourism levels will be sustained at levels seen prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly with respect to international markets. Additionally, from time to time, various events and industry-specific problems such as labor strikes have had a negative impact on tourism generally and in Hawai'i specifically. The occurrence of natural disasters, such as wildfires, hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and tsunamis, in Hawai'i or other parts of the world, could also have an adverse effect on our business or financial condition. For example, as a result of the August 2023 wildfires in West Maui, we have experienced a decline in tourism in this region that has adversely impacted our business and financial results.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"a924b58f-3a9e-492e-ae64-d6b4050870bc":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"a924b58f-3a9e-492e-ae64-d6b4050870bc\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"c703e0f6-4a5a-4f56-94c4-f58a4a4ad507\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"5xESHM83tG1WNbDVUqCaMstN4vct2oe9RfRSHlPoCeo=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"9531a790-a534-4a44-8704-e278e5d7983b\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"VpDqDoqKF7aXYhxbPef9dcnoU/QAZy/Ir762LdSoZJQ=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"b0bc7269-43e4-4aa0-ac9c-b49a41ce33ca\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"B+zI7CJJqIlizNnV3lQ7PWLeMmOGrEvKZjnmiTH6NKs=\"}},\"hash\":\"Z75SIXwK98+WPJpjoF5EBinGqy0m/rzeXHXI0+6bzos=\",\"text\":\"We expect demand for travel to Maui to remain depressed and continue to impact our business and financial results while West Maui continues to rebuild from wildfire devastation.

Our business is highly dependent on the price and availability of fuel. Our results, operations, and plans for decarbonization are heavily impacted by the price and availability of jet fuel. The cost of jet fuel remains high and the availability of jet fuel remains volatile. The cost and availability of jet fuel are subject to political, economic, and market factors that are generally outside of our control, including those related to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the widening conflict in the Middle East. Prices may be affected by many factors including, without limitation, the impact of political instability, crude oil production and refining capacity, sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production volume, unexpected changes in the availability of petroleum products due to disruptions to distribution systems or refineries, unpredicted increases in demand due to weather or the pace of global economic growth, inventory reserve levels of crude oil and other petroleum products, the relative fluctuation between the U.S. dollar and other major currencies, government taxes, regulations and subsidies that change the price or reduce the availability of jet fuel, and the actions of speculators in commodity markets. Because of the effects of these factors on the price and availability of jet fuel, the cost and future availability of fuel cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty. Also, due to the competitive nature of the airline industry, there can be no assurance that we will be able to increase our fares or other fees to sufficiently offset any increase in fuel prices. While we may enter into derivative agreements to protect against the volatility of fuel costs, there is no assurance that such agreements will protect us during unfavorable market conditions or that counterparties will be able to perform under these hedge arrangements.

For example, the value of the Japanese Yen has experienced significant volatility versus the U.S. dollar recently. Any weakening of the Japanese Yen relative to the U.S. dollar causes our flights, and travel in general, from Japan to Hawai'i to become more expensive to customers in Japan, which has and could continue to negatively impact our business.

Inflation may adversely affect us by increasing costs beyond what we can recover through price increases and may contribute to a recession. In the past year, inflation increased throughout the U.S. economy to levels not seen in decades. Although inflation rates have recently declined, inflation can adversely affect us by increasing the costs of labor, fuel, and other costs as well as by reducing demand for air travel. In an inflationary environment, depending on airline industry and other economic conditions, we may be unable to raise prices enough to keep up with the rate of inflation, which would reduce our profit margins. We have experienced, and continue to experience, increases in the prices of labor, fuel and other costs of providing service. Continued inflationary pressures could further impact our profitability. In response to inflation, the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates in an effort to reduce inflationary pressures.

As Domestic routes account for a significantly higher proportion of our revenue than they do for most of our competitors, a proportionately higher decline in demand for our domestic routes is likely to have a relatively greater adverse effect on our financial results than on those of our competitors. Sustained reduction in demand on our Domestic routes and continued industry capacity of major network carriers on routes to, from and within Hawai'i could adversely affect our financial results. Our business is affected by the competitive advantages held by network carriers in the North America market. The majority of competition on our North America routes is from network carriers such as Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Southwest Airlines, and United Airlines, all of whom have a number of competitive advantages. Primarily, network carriers generate passenger traffic from and throughout the U.S. mainland, which enables them to attract higher customer traffic levels as compared to us. In contrast, we lack a comparable direct network to feed passengers to our North America flights and are therefore more reliant on passenger demand in the specific cities we serve. We also rely on our code-share partner agreements (e.g. with JetBlue) to provide customers access to and from North American destinations currently unserved by us. Most network carriers operate from hubs, which can provide a built-in market of passengers depending on the economic strength of the hub city and the size of the customer group that frequents the airline. Our Honolulu and Maui hubs do not originate a large proportion of North American travel, nor do they have the population or potential customer franchise of a larger city to provide us with a significant built-in market. Passengers in the North American market, for the most part, do not originate in Honolulu, but on the U.S. mainland, making Honolulu primarily a destination rather than an origin of passenger traffic. Our North America and Neighbor Island routes are affected by increased capacity provided by our competitors. Prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic, certain of our competitors increased capacity to and within Hawai'i by introducing new routes and increasing the frequency of existing routes from North America to Hawai'i and by the introduction of additional flights within the neighbor islands.

Any increased competitor capacity that decreases our share of traffic to Hawai'i or between the neighbor islands could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our International routes are affected by competition from domestic and foreign carriers. During the three months ended March 31, 2024, approximately 22.6% of our passenger revenue was generated from our International routes. Our competitors on these routes include both domestic and foreign carriers. Both domestic and foreign competitors have a number of competitive advantages that may enable them to attract higher customer traffic levels as compared to us. Many of our domestic competitors are members of airline alliances, which provide customers access to each participating airline’s international network, allowing for convenience and connectivity to their destinations. These alliances formed by our domestic competitors have increased in recent years. In some instances, our domestic\\n---\\ncompetitors have been granted antitrust exemptions to form joint venture arrangements in certain geographies, further deepening their cooperation on certain routes. To mitigate this risk, we rely on code-share agreements with partner airlines to provide customers access to international destinations currently unserved by us.

We believe that our future success is dependent on the knowledge and expertise of our key executives and highly qualified management, technical, and other personnel. Attracting and retaining such personnel in the airline industry is highly competitive. We cannot be certain that we will be able to retain our key executives or attract other qualified personnel in the future. Any inability to retain our key executives, or other senior technical personnel, or attract and retain additional qualified executives, could have a negative impact on our operations. In addition, as we rebuild our operations as passenger demand recovers, and expand our operations through the acquisition of new aircraft and introduction of service to new markets, it may be challenging to attract a sufficient number of qualified personnel including pilots, mechanics and other skilled labor. As we compete with other carriers for qualified personnel, we also face the challenge of attracting individuals who embrace our team-oriented, friendly and customer-driven corporate culture.

AIRLINE INDUSTRY, REGULATION AND RELATED COSTS RISKS\\n\\nThe airline industry has substantial operating leverage and is affected by many conditions that are beyond its control, which could harm our financial condition and results of operations. Due to the substantial fixed costs associated with operating an airline, there is a disproportionate relationship between the cost of operating each flight and the number of passengers carried. However, the revenue generated from a particular flight is directly related to the number of passengers carried and the respective average fares applied. Accordingly, a decrease in the number of passengers carried and, when applicable, the aggregate effect of decreasing flights scheduled, causes a corresponding decrease in revenue that is likely to result in a disproportionately greater decrease in profits.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"d8b24a5b-9d56-4ddf-b64e-0c88f19d5ef6":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"d8b24a5b-9d56-4ddf-b64e-0c88f19d5ef6\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"c703e0f6-4a5a-4f56-94c4-f58a4a4ad507\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"5xESHM83tG1WNbDVUqCaMstN4vct2oe9RfRSHlPoCeo=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"77205181-6400-4460-9bea-36c982be159a\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"KW2GO0EPIoHNhcFX+mMQV1RdNvBA+ztxNM0Yoj8a1u4=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"196ed16f-b0aa-4051-b22d-6d53b16bed60\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"Pu+IHZ38ysfJ8EDC6iyEOs73fTbUJJXr5D/koRgomvM=\"}},\"hash\":\"ABxEtn06tVY4nv2swXcuBSA+hfSCZTzWX/+GgKhkGus=\",\"text\":\"Therefore, any future reductions in airline passenger traffic as a result of the following or other factors, which are largely outside of our control, will likely harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations:\\n\\n- decline in general economic conditions;\\n- threat of terrorist attacks and conflicts overseas;\\n- actual or threatened war and political instability;\\n- increased security measures or breaches in security;\\n- adverse weather and natural disasters, such as the Maui wildfires;\\n- changes in consumer preferences, perceptions, or spending patterns;\\n- increased costs related to security and safety measures;\\n- increased fares as a result of increases in fuel costs;\\n- outbreaks of contagious diseases or fear of contagion that affect travel behavior, such as occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic; and\\n- congestion or major construction at airports and actual or potential disruptions in the air traffic control system.

A failure to be in compliance, or a modification, suspension or revocation of any of our DOT/FAA authorizations or certificates, would have a material adverse impact on our operations. In 2018, Congress passed a five-year funding authorization for the FAA which was scheduled to expire in September 2023, and has been extended through May 10, 2024. The legislative process to renew this authorization (the FAA Reauthorization) could impact us, and the airline industry more generally, in numerous ways.

We are subject to risks associated with climate change, including increased regulation of our CO2 emissions and the potential increased impacts of severe weather events on our operations and infrastructure. There is increasing global regulatory focus on climate change and emissions of greenhouse gases, including CO2. In particular, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) has adopted rules such as the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), which is a market-based emissions offset program. Although the U.S. federal government has not yet enacted legislation to mandate that U.S. airlines participate in CORSIA, we are currently monitoring our international emissions for reporting purposes, and such data will be used in calculations to determine subsequent carbon offsetting requirements under the CORSIA program. At this time, we cannot predict the costs of complying with any future obligations under the CORSIA program. Regardless of the method of regulation or application of CORSIA, further policy changes with regard to climate change are possible, which could increase operating costs in the airline industry and, as a result, adversely affect our operations. In the event that CORSIA does not come into force as expected, we and other airlines could become subject to an unpredictable and inconsistent array of national or regional emissions restrictions, creating a patchwork of complex regulatory requirements that may affect global competitors differently. Concerns over climate change may result in the adoption of municipal, state, regional, and federal requirements or in changing business environments that may result in increased costs to the airline industry and us. In addition, several countries and U.S. states have adopted or are considering adopting programs to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. On January 20, 2021, the United States rejoined the Paris Climate Accord and the current Presidential administration has made climate change mitigation an important policy priority. For example, on September 9, 2021, the current Presidential administration launched the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge to scale up the production of SAF, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from aviation by 20% by 2030. Additionally, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency pressed for\\n---\\nambitious new aircraft greenhouse gas emission standards at international negotiations organized by ICAO in 2022.

Such activity may also impact us indirectly by increasing our operating costs, including fuel costs. We may not be able to increase revenue in proportion with such additional costs. We could incur significant costs to improve the climate resiliency of our infrastructure and otherwise prepare for, respond to, and mitigate such physical effects of climate change. We could also experience significant operational disruption, reduced demand and increased costs as a result of increases in the frequency, severity or duration of natural disasters, such as wildfires, like the August 2023 wildfires in West Maui, and severe weather events, like hurricanes, exacerbated by climate change.

For example, the U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act, which, among other changes, implements a 1% excise tax on certain stock buybacks and a 15% alternative minimum tax on adjusted financial statement income of certain companies. Furthermore, our implementation of new practices and processes designed to comply with changing tax laws and regulations could require us to make substantial\\n---\\nchanges to our business practices, allocate additional resources, and increase our costs, potentially adversely impacting our business, financial position and results of operations. As we continue to grow internationally, we may also be subject to taxation in jurisdictions around the world with increasingly complex tax laws, the application of which may be uncertain. The amount of taxes we pay in these jurisdictions could increase substantially as a result of changes in the applicable tax principles, including increased tax rates, new tax laws or revised interpretations of existing tax laws and precedents, potentially adversely affecting our liquidity and results of operations. For example, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development proposed a global minimum tax of 15%, which has been adopted by the European Union effective January 1, 2024. In addition, the authorities in these jurisdictions could review our tax returns and impose additional tax, interest and penalties, and the relevant authorities could claim that various withholding requirements apply to us or assert that benefits of tax treaties are not available to us or our subsidiaries, any of which could adversely impact us and our results of operations.

These provisions include, among others:\\n\\n- the ability of our Board of Directors to issue, without further action by the stockholders, series of undesignated preferred stock, or rights to acquire preferred stock, that could dilute the interest of, or impair the voting power of, holders of our common stock or could also be used as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control;\\n- advance notice procedures for stockholder proposals to be considered at stockholders’ meetings and for nominations of candidates for election to our Board of Directors;\\n- the ability of our Board of Directors to fill vacancies on the board;\\n- a prohibition against stockholders taking action by written consent;\\n- a prohibition against stockholders calling special meetings of stockholders; and\\n- super-majority voting requirements to modify or amend specified provisions of our certificate of incorporation. ---\\n# SECURITIES OFFERINGS RISKS\\n\\nIn connection with the issuance of Hawaiian’s enhanced equipment trust certificate, our indebtedness and liabilities could limit the cash flow available for our operations, and consequently expose us to risks that could materially adversely affect the resources available to us and Hawaiian to satisfy our obligations under such certificates.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS JETBLUE AIRWAYS CORPORATION NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)\\n\\nWe have financed certain aircraft with Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificates (\\\"EETCs\\\"). One of the benefits of this structure is being able to finance several aircraft at one time, rather than individually. The structure of EETC financing is that we create pass-through trusts in order to issue pass-through certificates. The proceeds from the issuance of these certificates are then used to purchase equipment notes which are issued by us and are secured by our aircraft. These trusts meet the definition of a variable interest entity (\\\"VIE\\\"), as defined in Topic 810, Consolidation of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\\\"FASB\\\") Codification, and must be considered for consolidation in our financial statements. Our assessment of our EETCs considers both quantitative and qualitative factors including the purpose for which these trusts were established and the nature of the risks in each. The main purpose of the trust structure is to enhance the creditworthiness of our debt obligation through certain bankruptcy protection provisions and liquidity facilities, and also to lower our total borrowing cost. We concluded that we are not the primary beneficiary in these trusts because our involvement in them is limited to principal and interest payments on the related notes, the trusts were not set up to pass along variability created by credit risk to us, and the likelihood of our defaulting on the notes. Therefore, we have not consolidated these trusts in our financial statements. 2024 Sale-Leaseback Transactions\\n\\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2024, we entered into $332 million of sale-leaseback transactions.

For the effective portion of hedges, when aircraft fuel is consumed and the related derivative contract settles, any gain or loss previously recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) is recognized in aircraft fuel expense. All cash flows related to our fuel hedging derivatives are classified as operating cash flows. Ineffectiveness occurs, in certain circumstances, when the change in the total fair value of the derivative instrument differs from the change in the value of our expected future cash outlays for the purchase of aircraft fuel. If a hedge does not qualify for hedge accounting, the periodic changes in its fair value are recognized in interest income and other.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION\\n\\nITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\\n---\\n# Pratt & Whitney\\n\\nIn July 2023, Pratt & Whitney, a division of Raytheon Technologies, announced the requirement, mandated by the Federal Aviation Administration (\\\"FAA\\\"), for removal of certain engines for inspection due to contaminated powdered metal used in high-pressure turbine disks on the V2500, PW1100G, and PW1500G engine types. These engines power our Airbus A320, Airbus A220 and Airbus A321neo fleets. The contaminated powdered metal affects engines manufactured between October 2015 and September 2021. Engines are now required to be inspected after they have reached a reduced number of cycles dependent on the fleet type. As of March 31, 2024, we had nine aircraft grounded for required inspection. The Company currently expects each removed engine to take up to 360 days to complete a shop visit and return to a serviceable condition and expects an average of 11 aircraft out of service throughout the year. In 2023, we reached a confidential settlement agreement with Pratt & Whitney, which was intended to address damages incurred by us in 2023 due to the grounding of the affected engines. Into 2024 and beyond, we expect to have a certain number of engines grounded and, therefore, will continue to assess the resulting impact on our future capacity plans.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"863c31b1-654b-4ea9-ba30-74c8715ab845":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"863c31b1-654b-4ea9-ba30-74c8715ab845\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"c703e0f6-4a5a-4f56-94c4-f58a4a4ad507\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"5xESHM83tG1WNbDVUqCaMstN4vct2oe9RfRSHlPoCeo=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"fa8394ba-7ee8-41ba-811e-3f47d1858d90\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"7/f/Aqonk6xMFmu+Yr+tgOsraGWeoNeze0uIX1SvSJ4=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"969c4fb3-7a77-43c5-ad33-f2fe54eda478\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"dMijXFASHYUZ3U+UQQ907C8/EclOifAb9OtaaxCmC5s=\"}},\"hash\":\"ijfwV/4LDfaTZCiZuNas91730vgfR+ibkb5D2xfQ9UE=\",\"text\":\"We are currently working with Pratt & Whitney on compensation arrangements.

This compares to net loss of $192 million, an operating loss of $242 million and an operating margin of (10.4)% for the three months ended March 31, 2023. Our loss per share was $2.11 for the first quarter of 2024 compared to a loss per share of $0.58 for the same period in 2023. Net loss increased $524 million year-over-year primarily due to the write off of Spirit-related costs as a result of the termination of the Merger Agreement discussed in Note 12 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Report. Our reported results for the three months ended March 31, 2024 included the effects of special items. Adjusting for these one-time items, our adjusted net loss (1) was $145 million, adjusted operating loss (1) was $157 million, adjusted operating margin (1) was (7.1)%, and adjusted loss per share (1) was $0.43 for the three months ended March 31, 2024. Our reported results for the three months ended March 31, 2023 included the effects of special items. Adjusting for these one-time items, our adjusted net loss (1) was $111 million, adjusted operating loss (1) was $130 million, adjusted operating margin (1) was (5.6)%, and adjusted loss per share (1) was $0.34 for the three months ended March 31, 2023.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Aircraft Fuel Aircraft fuel decreased by $160 million, or 20.4%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023. Over the same period, the average fuel price decreased by 17.3% to $2.97 per gallon and fuel consumption decreased by 3.8%, or 9 million gallons. Salaries, Wages and Benefits Salaries, wages and benefits increased $82 million, or 11.0%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 driven by wage rate increases. The wage rate increase was primarily due to the new pilot union contract effective March 1, 2023, which included an initial pay rate increase of 14% and an additional 3% pay rate increase effective August 2023. Aircraft Rent Aircraft rent decreased $5 million, or 16.1%, in the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023, primarily due to fewer leases for Airbus A320 aircraft and Embraer E190 aircraft. Maintenance, Materials, and Repairs Maintenance, materials, and repairs decreased $44 million, or 24.2%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due to timing and the type of maintenance events that occurred during the period. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses consist of the following categories: outside services, airport expenses (including expenses related to ground handling, skycap, security, and catering services), personnel expenses, professional and legal fees, onboard supplies, shop and office supplies, bad debts, communication costs and taxes other than payroll and fuel taxes. Other operating expenses increased $22 million, or 6.3%, for the three months ended March 31, 2024 compared to the same period in 2023 due in part to information technology service costs, outside services, and personnel expenses.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"306273a0-0c57-4b23-bb5c-486084727581":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"306273a0-0c57-4b23-bb5c-486084727581\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"c703e0f6-4a5a-4f56-94c4-f58a4a4ad507\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"5xESHM83tG1WNbDVUqCaMstN4vct2oe9RfRSHlPoCeo=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"828ea339-73b3-4b48-abc1-12220352929c\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"ZpDZKBfFmnFlgxHuV1FTQ9UrgDAj14+Jwl4wK2GEN2A=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"8d90bbff-43f6-44a9-b10d-6351a8c1a77c\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"XbPUnVnTsg5hwo1T7jDm1V3HMzS93A6uyVb+nEU2S9w=\"}},\"hash\":\"SR9eYc3dCvXChrLa4LDmgK7ykuLmRs8HCn6cKQefsr0=\",\"text\":\"Special Items For the three months ended March 31, 2024, special items included the following: •$532 million relating to Spirit-related costs; •$15 million relating to voluntary opt-out costs; and •$15 million relating to Embraer E190 fleet transition costs. ---\\n# For the three months ended March 31, 2023, special items included the following:\\n\\n$95 million relating to union contract costs;\\n$17 million relating to Spirit-related costs.

Even with the flight cutbacks, we experienced and continue to expect challenges in the operating environment. Consequently, we believe quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results may not necessarily be meaningful; you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance. Except for uncertainty related to the cost of aircraft fuel, we expect our expenses to continue to increase as we acquire additional aircraft, as our fleet ages, and as we expand the frequency of flights in existing markets as well as enter into new markets. Operational challenges impacted our business in the first quarter of 2024. These challenges include disruptions in our supply chains and those of our business partners, leading to aircraft delivery delays. Additionally, reliability challenges with some of our aircraft engines using new technology have led to grounded aircraft events. These challenges have resulted - and are expected to continue to result - in flight delays and cancellations. # LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\\n\\nThe airline business is capital intensive. Our ability to successfully execute our growth plans is largely dependent on the continued availability of capital on attractive terms. In addition, our ability to successfully operate our business depends on maintaining sufficient liquidity. We believe we have adequate resources from a combination of cash and cash equivalents, investment securities on hand, and available lines of credit. Additionally, our unencumbered assets could be an additional source of liquidity, if necessary. At March 31, 2024, we had unrestricted cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, and long-term marketable securities of approximately $1.7 billion, which we believe will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months from the date of this Report, and we expect to meet our long-term liquidity needs with our projected cash from operations, available lines of credit and debt financing.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\\n\\nExcept as described below, there have been no material changes in market risks from the information provided in Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk included in our 2023 Form 10-K. # Aircraft Fuel\\n\\nOur results of operations are affected by changes in the price and availability of aircraft fuel. Market risk is estimated as a hypothetical 10% increase in the March 31, 2024 cost per gallon of fuel. Based on projected fuel consumption for the next 12 months, including the impact of our hedging position, such an increase would result in an increase to aircraft fuel expense of approximately $262 million. As of March 31, 2024, we have hedged approximately 27% of our projected fuel requirement for the second quarter of 2024, 3% for the third quarter of 2024, and 5% for the fourth quarter of 2024. # Interest\\n\\nOur earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on interest expense from variable-rate debt instruments and on interest income generated from our cash and investment balances. The interest rate is fixed for $4.6 billion of our debt and finance lease obligations, with the remaining $395 million having floating interest rates. As of March 31, 2024, if interest rates were on average 100 basis points higher year-over-year, our annual interest expense would increase by approximately $4 million. This amount is determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical change in interest rates on our variable rate debt. If interest rates were to average 100 basis points lower in 2024 than they were during 2023, our interest income from cash and investment balances would decrease by approximately $7 million. This amount is determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical change in interest rates on the balances of our money market funds and short-term, interest-bearing investments for the trailing twelve-month period. # ITEM 4.\",\"textTemplate\":\"\",\"metadataSeparator\":\"\\n\",\"type\":\"TEXT\"}","__type__":"TEXT"},"505e9f12-a882-4c89-aa59-b5f4fa403f4c":{"__data__":"{\"id_\":\"505e9f12-a882-4c89-aa59-b5f4fa403f4c\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"excludedEmbedMetadataKeys\":[],\"excludedLlmMetadataKeys\":[],\"relationships\":{\"SOURCE\":{\"nodeId\":\"c703e0f6-4a5a-4f56-94c4-f58a4a4ad507\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"5xESHM83tG1WNbDVUqCaMstN4vct2oe9RfRSHlPoCeo=\"},\"PREVIOUS\":{\"nodeId\":\"3855e0fd-6d8c-478e-83dd-d1c650c407dd\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"8ObKp2AR+qE9dovpCkkRagCUb34ZiFMTmNB3PsVk4Vg=\"},\"NEXT\":{\"nodeId\":\"684d0bcc-156f-4b45-abfe-2793ee8521a7\",\"metadata\":{\"file_path\":\"/workspaces/finevolia_app/finevolia/data/edgar.pdf\",\"file_name\":\"edgar.pdf\"},\"hash\":\"vGQp7H4KUmxQlXhGLcW+2WZ4+KGn8JaIFdr6lG0kmJA=\"}},\"hash\":\"pWDqViX9czCa3GewKftcP2ll4EuCAOtdOEVNNBUkEZc=\",\"text\":\"# ITEM 4.
